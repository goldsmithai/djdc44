  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 14:41 ): Are the philosophical. But yeah, we're getting one side, The issue, The idea of the mission of the cover is to figure out. How do you move away from the mean, sort of rationalistic way that unlocks future creativity and alignment with deeper human and individualistic needs, right? That is a challenging thing. The trick I think, though, is,",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 14:41 ): the more you can connect to ground truth, that is objective, right, things like simulation or things like running code. So ironic again, maybe it's not right, but they tend to actually be very technical things that allow you to unlock a deviation from what seems like sterile and purely technical. if you want to write better, this English that allows more creativity. I think ironically the path to get there is to understand floral verification and semiconductor design and bake that in. Because the beauty with this ground truth approach and feedback is then you can actually sort of leverage. The fact that you can run ai a lot, not have a human in the loop and get Some form of alignment by having a better understanding of Really, what are we talking about here? We're not talking in terms of some, language that we don't understand what it means. We can't agree on what it means. We can't actually move it.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 14:41 ): Again in this rationalistic rather empirical way away from the meat, So it's a movement away from data. Science is actually the weird part of, I think what we want to differentiate ourselves but concretely what that looks like I think is hitting the nail on the head of these six use cases. We already talked about and we already record,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 14:41 ): Really.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 14:41 ): took notes on. I think those are still the right use cases because they're the use cases that we can actually test\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 14:41 ): Yes.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 14:41 ): because they'll help us develop our own company. We have to have this all for current self referential thing because anything that we don't need to do on a weekly basis as a company, we won't really be able to afford to spend the time developing that domain expertise, and then testing, and I think we're already running into that problem, that it's like the use cases, where you were able to find some error. In our thing was developing database coach because you needed that to actually work on the website itself. And so,",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 14:41 ): A trick then becomes.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 14:41 ): Developing full stack Web application is going to be that should be our number one, use case because we need full stack web application. So the point where we do get pretty quickly, I think to the point where we're not really developing the application directly anymore, but we're having the AI work on our application and then anywhere where it can't do it. We're working on the AI to actually make that work Probably more on the domain specific side. we're gonna add a calendar. Okay, we'll never done that before. Let's bake that in and maybe have our AI really rely less on using these underlying models to have the knowledge and more on our own opinionated idea of doing Web development, And that's gonna have to be baked into the whole DNA of that thing and if some users like No I want to build love patience. I want to build locations. This idea is We can't. Yeah, because this is the trick. that's your ability.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 14:41 ): There's this mean in the models and that's these sort of average best practices of react and all these common frameworks. And if we're gonna steer away from that we have to actually steer it through something else I don't think I'm kind of given up on the idea that we can actually use prompting to or fine-tune or any technique to basically Now we have a more dynamic system that allows the user to express their opinions. because the reality it's too difficult to test it because of the sheer quantity of examples you need to run evals and to actually go in and not have the user have the owners to go and say Okay, when it did something wrong, how do we debug that? How do we improve it?",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 14:46 ): So the future. It does it right. I think we have to actually be opinion and say, Okay, here's our guide to building lab applications. Here are examples to build our evals and then, when we try to do some change and it doesn't build the website correctly and get a working website, we dig in and we concretely say Okay are we gonna change this prompt to make the website work rather than another degree of indirection of kind of saying, We see this one particular user wasn't happy because they hit the dislike button but we don't really know exactly because the problem is maybe the user didn't actually have a robust system for developing a wild application. The first, maybe they haven't thought through everything and so the reason why they don't like our output it doesn't work but the question is Does it not work because our AI didn't do a good job or because they had a bad idea in the first place and so I think we have to kind of really to say the whole point is to ask someone who's not a web developer to use the tool.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 14:46 ): Old complex way applications, not to have a web developer be able to go in and really be able to be like I am now deciding every detail of this. Otherwise, they kind of just write the code themselves, and doing it, kind of That's what I think we're in this halfway moment. you're using these chat tools today but we're discussing exactly kind of how we want the website, you build, and then you're really going in and using it to more quickly, generate some code and then really verifying that it was exactly the code you kind of had in mind,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 14:46 ): Know.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 14:46 ): You're not really giving a big leash to the AI to be like Hey come up with some novel idea here and I think if we hit that full stack Web development,",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 14:46 ): If we hit the, \u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 14:46 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 14:46 ): the game development, I think that's just another good one. I mean I've got enough background developing games so it's a fun thing to do and then I think the embedded and semiconductors even though I took that off the list, I do think that's actually the long-term goal because what I really look at and go back to what were we talking about six months ago? What was I talking about? a year ago, it's this idea that",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 14:46 ): When you actually get down to the semiconductor level and mode one you're highly differentiated there's absolutely no question if we have a semiconductor AI tool that's a smaller area of competition than just general chatbot even proposal writing or something and then when you hit that ground truth and then you start building the software stack back on top of that. You actually allow the higher levels of software to enable formal verification, other techniques, where you connect to ground truth and simulating software at a higher level and that allows also cybersecurity gains. And so kind of going back to you. If you look at the ads Microsoft is running on buses. Yeah, a couple months ago it was very specifically. We're the leader in cyber security, those are the two areas themselves that",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 14:46 ): Were you the AI in some level is actually a semiconductor play, right? There's other areas to AI but that's the deep idea. And so I think the trick is keeping an eye on the prize in a way, but also recognize that okay, what are we building? The short term to kind of get there? And I do think starting with the full stack developments, the other one is the research of AI papers themselves. suppose. The other thing I started working on is using rag to actually pull in all these pdfs of the AI papers able to do a better job. And then using the headless browser to also be able to say Okay read. So these, releases that are coming out, on open eyes website or on Instagram, so I'd say Okay extract. how is it doing on all these evals? what's the current moment in External to us allowing us to focus on, what we're actually building and then the same thing with the marketing of saying, Okay, developing that content marketing again",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 14:46 ): The content market I think is, ironically the trickiest one because the least connected to ground truth. We can't test the marketing as easily as we can run code. And then again, I think those whole ideas, we don't want to produce the meat. If we use Chatgivity to write the content marketing, it looks like all the other chat Gbt generated content and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 14:46 ): He?",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 14:46 ): that's actually really bad. And if we use an SEO driven approach, there's something where we want to have mods. We want to have a little bit of SEO time for approach to have a general understanding of what performs, but that shouldn't directly drive. What the output is, I think that connection It's a nail in the head of what you mean by moving away. From me, if we build content, the exactly what appears to be highest performing. It's incredibly competitive with other content like that,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 14:46 ): E.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 14:46 ): We want to go content. That's actually opinionated and you're uses rationality to directly move from our core ideas to say",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 14:46 ): I'm using and there's no guarantee. Then that the content performs. right, that's sort of the traffic and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 14:46 ): Know.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 14:46 ): you have to say how do you provide feedback to actually improve that when you can't simply just sort of Follow the data, right? Because it's the whole point, you follow the data,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 14:46 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 14:46 ): you're gonna follow the data to the mean, And not the hill, if you view it as a metaphor, right as some landscape where it's like, everyone else is doing some local optimization problem and there's some mountain that are climbing to the top of and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 14:46 ): No.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 14:51 ): you're like, Yeah, but you see that fog over there. I'm just gonna assume that there's a bigger mountain somewhere out there in that fall\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 14:51 ): No.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 14:51 ): because on average, There's always some taller mountain than the one you're currently looking at because yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 14:51 ): and a lot of this idea of a gradient ascent. and I've talked with JD a lot but I don't really talk this idea that instead of viewing it you want to climb up the shallowest curve. you really want to actually take this? You want to get as high as you can, as quickly as you can, You want to find the steepest area in climate and say, okay, what gets this way up to? these kind of big chunks where we kind of move up into the most difficult thing, because that's where we kind of get visibility into the rest of the trade-off with that is in how to do that while simultaneously in the short term saying Okay we're not funded. So how do we generate revenue? Because we don't have revenue, we don't have resources to deploy to some of these things, right?",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 14:51 ): And on the other hand, I think this is gonna be the trickiest part is saying Okay, if we just build something that kind of works, will anybody actually pay for that right? Is that differentiate at all? Even to the point of getting anybody paying for it? And then the trick is, like, Okay, Is there some way we can thread that needle of finding A single thing that's just like, this is the killer app This clearly is differentiated but magically somehow",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 14:51 ): it inherently. What we're doing is fighting the nature of things by saying, We are not spending any capital expense but somehow we're gonna have some differentiated product, those there's no magic bullet it's virtually impossible. Because there's no bird entry inherently in. And if there is a very entry we can't overcome that very entry. And so trying to figure out creativity, creatively something that's different. Maybe is more niche, I think that's like",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 14:51 ): emergent, I guess that's the other part that we've been really focused in the last month. I'm like, Hey, we're building this thing and the thing it's that mean reversion. It's like What do we build? the very average thing, The thing that's the same as the other thing. that's good because's straightforward we know you're able to build it on the other hand. It's not very open to serendipity or sort of emergent behavior where we kind of try things, and stumble upon on successes. Okay, I'll change years to what you're working on but I also want you to keep that in mind, even as you're working on the chat thing sometimes, especially the websockets part with that, you might have to just try things and then,",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 14:51 ): Know.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 14:51 ): See what happens in development and then we kind of take that next step and that adds time. I think. One thing I've noticed if we're like, Hey this is gonna take two days. Yeah. That's a nice gas, But if you try to make it guaranteed to take two days, maybe it means we're not really exploring that possibility space or doing research like the level we can. Sometimes we want to do that. Sometimes we want to say Hey who's already get the thing done? But I think in particular for Web sockets and we're stuff where it's to come up where Postgres has a lot of",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 14:51 ): Yeah, 30 years of use of relational database we can kind of just follow best practices. Rest has a lot of the whole beauty of rest as you can just follow best practices and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 14:51 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 14:51 ): you're really safe we were gonna see what the Websockets is it's the very nature of the sick, potential cyclical flow of data that you can't get graphs are Have algorithm complexity that's tricky, right? You always just come up with some solution through the problem and that requires just sort of having playing around with stuff and kind of seeing practically what the trade-offs are rather than just cut and dry, kind of best practices.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 14:51 ): today I want \u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 14:51 ): All right, we'll change gears. I'll let you take over.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 14:51 ): I wanted to know this thing we have the restaurant so I think sometimes it is good but only the one use case, I found word of it was send some live changes like Lyogenous. Meaning when AI sensor is falls to our server,\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 14:51 ): Look.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 14:51 ): and if the user has that open with that particular child, you can say particular chat ideas open \u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 14:51 ): Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 14:51 ): and this is the message, then only Talk it to send that message. Otherwise, all things is Why rest API only like sending the message to the server,\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 14:51 ): Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 14:56 ): getting deleting the child loading all the chats that is already gone, and the one use case is only this thing. The AI sends the message to our server and our server in dunsents to the live sockets which is a little. The thing is How that thing will happen. I was thinking of that Also that thing the publisher subscriber thing but I'm not getting how that thing will work response.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 14:56 ): so yeah, start, I mean, yeah, yeah, this is what I was kind of thinking, Start without using red as that.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 14:56 ): Yeah, that only",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 14:56 ): Start by getting something to work, because I think the reality is there's multiple layers to the website complexity, and you need to just get a little bit of running, practice basically with the basic WebSocket stuff. Right. You\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 14:56 ): Mmm.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 14:56 ): I mean just seeing how that flow really works and the reality is if we're not worried about scale, we don't which at this point what's not really worry about. Let's just focus on getting the next I realize too. Yeah, we're making up changes, we'll just focus on this getting this iteration kind of done getting the basic WebSocket some sort of WebSocket added so that,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 14:56 ): yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 14:56 ): you just have experience with that and then putting that into production and the reality is We have one server, the server terminates, the Web socket that screws also the one that's being pushed, the message that it has the end point receiving it from the AI. So it's not so tricky to match up the user that has the open connection with the thing.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 14:56 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 14:56 ): And then I would say just sort of hack it together. Basically you're gonna need to Then just do exactly what you just describe. Don't worry about Whatever you get that AI endpoint saying",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 14:56 ): Simply have a global variable in the node thing. That's a table called, an object called connections. Let's say, and each,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 14:56 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 14:56 ): those connections will basically map the user the session ID. Whichever one is at this point and then maps that to a Web socket connection object which,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 14:56 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 14:56 ): which could be just like a function that it is a callback.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 14:56 ): And that's the message. Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 14:56 ): And then that actually sends to that WebSocket. You can wrap it However, you kind of want. And then just I say hacking together in the sense that if you find that the way I just described it isn't exactly. Be like, but I got the message to pass. That's why whatever gets the message to pass to the user is fine,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 14:56 ): Okay, got it ordered.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 14:56 ): And then from the AI rest API yet does the WebSocket",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 14:56 ): And the very God did the thing is that then we have the global whatever which has all the connections not like as a maps type of thing and\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 14:56 ): Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 14:56 ): whenever AI sends that response, you check it with the map that it had Is this tattoo that any other soccer like all you can see any of the user ID and then send it,\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 14:56 ): Yeah. Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 14:56 ): that's okay, okay? And second thing was like,\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 14:56 ): Exactly. Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 14:56 ): Yesterday, I did this thing. The script for that thing, what you was describing the mini date of this kind of thing like getting all the chance for that day type of thing. And mail format, I have added my mail and a daily runs around that or four o'clock I guess. Something like that.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 14:56 ): Guys. Awesome.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 14:56 ): I've tried to send one, I got that. But the problem is now the end points are changing. This thing organization points I've been changed and what do you say? And the parameters, which we are passing through, the end points are also changed.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 14:56 ): are because We have now the conversation ID, which we require to pass today and point as well as the chat ID and the message all together. because we are starting both the wrong line.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 14:56 ): Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 14:56 ): One particular idea you guys in one row kind of thing. So I'm kind of changed that thing also. and what do you say? that thing has been done and for back, couple to the script is written but I'm not tested that you are discussing on something that volumes and partitions for that thing.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 14:56 ): Yeah, don't worry about the volume is for, now, that I was just kind of saying that, when we go to add that later,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 14:56 ): Yeah. Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:01 ): it should be seamless without modifying the color because that. We don't need it for now. We're just keep everything simple, just kind of get everything good together because that's the thing, like aren't you done four or five changes that are all different from each other? I mean, at this point I think just wrangle everything, whatever you kind of need to do to get done with this iteration and update the production thing so that we get kind of into that practice cycle of more of the closer, the agile thing of every two weeks or three weeks because you're kind of seeing if you win it, get a little bit longer in that it kind of goes on even longer and then someone like, God, so many changes. We talk about so many ideas and then the delay between having a certain idea and saying, it took a month later.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:01 ): Actually implement that we tested it. So I mean at this point it's enough changes like we ordered a bunch of and I just don't worry, all the stuff we talked about will be good, a future iterations. We might say, Okay now we're running into a problem with this technique. Let's do it a slightly different way, but for now. Yeah, I'm gonna leave it up to you. Yeah. Just kind of like I was a hack, it to get, whatever way you kind of get it to work. So the Web sockets keep that simple,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:01 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:01 ): with the role. I mean, I do think that even the backups for this one. Hey, if you don't figure out how to do the rollbacks, we'll do that for the next generation you got back up that's the first half of that and we'll just know that. something we need to do rollbacks in the next iteration. So I would say at this point. Yeah. If you pray with the idea, the double diamonds, It's like a lot of times you go wide Internet, right? You kind of okay have all these and somebody you have to kind of narrow it down. And I think at that point, we're okay with the widest part.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:01 ): Keep removing ideas even if we talked about that I'm saying. if you haven't started that yet, whatever just won't make into this iteration. So yeah, don't worry about the rollback to the backups. if you've written it, great, we'll be able to see once you've been in production, we'll be able to manual can say, Okay, we have backup somewhere. Good they're the files,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:01 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:01 ): there's the data that's taking We'll be able to see how much even just doing backups allows to see. Are you running into a data storage problem because they're backing up too much of. we won't have that problem but Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:01 ): ",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:01 ): So, just keep it simple, whatever. And then yeah, for the database chain, that just figure out a way to kind of get it done. And we can always rely on the",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:01 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:01 ): that the backup,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:01 ): Then back up.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:01 ): the cloud level,\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:01 ): for",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:01 ): Yeah, and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:01 ): no one living was I was thinking this thing was the roll back. Everything was that sticking out the rollback Suppose, actually shifting, we have been alive, migration, you can say, Yeah, to the new data is a new table, you are saying and that is all the conversion taking place and all the new messages. Now whichever are coming or getting added to this new table. And suppose we want to roll back back to the previous one,\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:01 ): yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:01 ): how the new data which is\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:01 ): Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:01 ): which has got stuck in that thing, you can say how that will be migrated to this previous one.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:01 ): Yeah, I mean I want one is really the rollback script has to do that. Sometimes, that's one way to do it,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:01 ): Okay.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:01 ): Which is it actually define? How you go back the other way for us for now the answer is gonna basically be like we're either gonna lose them or we'll have to manually",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:01 ): Run, manually copy them back over basically saying do you know Write a standalone script afterwards? That's scan this new database, Grab any changes that are recent and then do a right to the old database and these old rows, Modify the script you kind of have, but you got to do instrument after the fact to see if gosh So the trick is usually the rollback, this is where automated testing is so valuable, Because you don't want to do the rollback two days after you do the migration. That's like a big problem.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:01 ): That.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:01 ): You wish you want to be okay. we take five minutes and run some tests. And if any of those tests fails, we roll back at, And then, you might actually lose all the changes that happen in that five minute window in certain cases,",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:01 ): Yeah, I mean a lot of it depends. This is where again the database administration part. A lot of it is you don't have these cut and dry rules because it depends on the nature of the data and whether or not it live updated and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:01 ): ",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:06 ): our case. a lot of these quasi batch numbers internal to a business or maybe the healthcare They're PDFs for every new insurance plan that came out that month right but they can just pause that stream for while they do Migration from the other system that's job is straight PDFs from websites. just pause the scraping for an hour and then start back up on the scraping, once they've done the database migration, So depending on a lot of data for actually has upstream controls because they're coming from other databases or they're coming from other services in our case this is not that it's like users are why? real users in real time our interaction",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:06 ): I expecting very, very low latency, even a banking application, for example,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:06 ): .",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:06 ): right? Could in the US system? I mean, it's part of the reason why people talk about switching to a currency, central bank, digital currencies or something like that or even like the UPI system, it doesn't necessarily clear instantaneously. And the reason is the onus, that it puts on, every single banking software is actually counter to how those banking systems maintain their reliability, they do, what I did when I did the payment to last time. It didn't happen instantly, even though it had the previous time and I was sending it to the same address. This one had a five hour delay but the reality is that could have been because the bank that actually is like doing the final clearing.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:06 ): Has sent a message within that system, being like We're doing maintenance for the next five hours. We're not going to clear transactions, and there's no guarantee that banking transactions and almost any banking system are truly instantaneous, In the US.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:06 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:06 ): T plus three business days and now the stocks now are guaranteed to actually clear, within t, plus one days.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:06 ): Yeah, in India.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:06 ): So, you just basically instantaneous if you actually want to get the money out and transfer to another bank,",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:06 ): That could take one day. so a lot of these systems are based on this idea that when you need really high reliability So it's the cap that we talked a lot about the cap theorem in the past, Consistency? Availability and partition ability, theoretically, you can only have two of the three, right? And so there's no way to have the perfect and that's like, what kind of where the rubber hits the road of database administration. You have to always respect that Cap is a true-ism. So one is you have to understand the idea the network can always fail in any real network and therefore Partitionability always has to be a wow in some you case and then that means you're always making a trip inconsistency and availability. If you want to use your to always have something work 100% of the time and have it be instant, you cannot ever have consistency. There's a theoretical truth, right? You can only have consistency and availability when the network is instantaneous, right? And the",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:06 ): Is recognizing that? What is a user care about our users? What pretty good availability. But the reality is This is why these AI companies don't have actually great availability. I mean, there's a lot of downtime in the big scheme of things and that's better than having bad, AI output. We're then other automated systems can't really rely on, the out open AI struggles with this a lot where you use chat gbt and there's really garbage results today especially a year ago and they're downgraded to some other model and, at the end of the day for us, I think part of that trailer, that short term is we have to be willing to just have some down time, what we're doing migration.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:06 ): Then.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:06 ): And so whatever that kind of looks like or versus the lack of consistency, which is worse, where users, I spent five minutes doing this chat and then it deleted my chat, right?",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:06 ): We really don't want that case and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:06 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:06 ): so probably when we're actually doing the migration, we should take the site down for 10 minute and then for some reason, when we just manually test it, we don't automated testing, but the good part is our system is not that complex. So, if we do five minutes of manual testing, it probably means that the basic idea is working correctly because our AI only has one endpoint, It's back to one endpoint, It's just not that complicated. So I think we should be able to quickly kind of saying, Okay, once ever and we're not doing date we're not doing push to production once a day or twice a day, right into a psycho vision saying, Yeah, every two weeks we,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:06 ): Man.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:06 ): at a reasonable amount of features, we push it into production, There's 10 minutes of downtime or even an hour of downtime, every couple weeks in the worst case for something goes wrong.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:11 ): Okay That's pretty good. As long as we have that. last week when I was really harping on this we need to really be focused on this idea of production was more of this general idea that we need to be just kind of focusing on those concerns rather than this idea of where we're not allowed to just really develop in the same way that we do during development. At the same time, we've got a balance and kind of say okay, Yeah, everything's been focused on, improving our ability over time to manage a production website without a big team, that's such a big challenge but practically because we don't have a big team we have to sort of choose our battles, every kind of completion. The worst thing we can do is just not make any changes to production for really really long period of time and then not develop.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:11 ): Iterative sort of practice a push of modifying stuff and production and messing with production. But right now if we let it go another, two or three weeks before we push something to production, We'll kind of be falling to that trap of just production is this thing that's all sanitized and sits there and we're afraid to touch which at this point is kind of reasonable because it is kind of fragile. But that's where that reiteration, we're using to start adding these features \u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:11 ): Not.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:11 ): visibility and backups are kind of the two. Yeah, exactly what's happening. Any of us is somebody say anything goes wrong, we can fix it. You then can feel really, really safe in sort of modifying that system. And then closing that loop I really get into a loop in the future where the core ideas like Web sockets and the database, schema aren't changing. And it's easier to say No we're pushing updates once a week because the updates are our kind of causing or\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:11 ): .",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:11 ): they're like, we add this your inter,",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:11 ): Feature, we add to the schema because we're gonna find too. Is that what's happening with the schema right now is being one of the tougher changes? We're actually saying Okay we want to take one of these core tables and modify it the name of it Okay that actually requires a big change in the future. We will probably have more cases where it's something like. we want to add a field to this table.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:11 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:11 ): Okay, we add the field to the table and then we have to worry about how more the breaking happens in the code, that has to assume that a lot of those entries. Don't have the new field filled\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:11 ): ",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:11 ): Not so much in the database itself. We're in all those, it's not or whatever. And then the new ones are adding to that field, and it doesn't break. And in the old stuff, whereas this one's gonna be trickier,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:11 ): Then.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:11 ): but that's fine. Even if we have three hours of downtime or the two of us are on the call, doing the migration. And then everything goes, down the two. I think we want to start when you're the migration.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:11 ): Okay, let's take a snapshot of all of our instances, we have the backups but just as, an easy way to do a real hard rollback and then, basically turn off the application instance, anyway for the snapshot. And then we start the downtime window. And that's like, Okay, now we migrate the database, I know we turn back on, the instance and then we like maybe even enabling a firewall on the instance, something, that's a little trick. I think in reality what we can really just do is kind of assume that unless we've gotten a bunch of users.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:11 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:11 ): In the short term they're like Okay we're gonna actually pretty safe that this is kind of quasi broken for an hour or two it'll actually be fine and then just kind of open up the engine xlogs and look and see okay this is what I usually do is right before, making a big change, just manually look to see if there's any user actively using and that does not require a complex visibility because you can just grab the engine next. Logs for any points up slash chat Okay if it's just us that have been doing that if there's some other IP address that's like, there's a person sitting on this site, using it, then you're gonna turn it what, you're off the firewall or even I say Turn on fire. just",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:16 ): The hardest trick is for us to feel like we have to test it. What kind of not allowing other users, to access it. And so one of the easier to do is break it for an hour and then turn it back on because if there were any users they probably stopped using it when it's not working for an hour and so they're probably not using it as soon as you turn it back on It's like Okay it is live again we could have people writing to the new database and causing problems but hey we're probably not because it's unlikely that a user use the site and then stop using it and then got on exactly at the moment that we turned it back on and then if that is the case, we'll manually go through and write a rollback script and be good practice how to do that at that point anyway and",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:16 ): The triggers. As long as you're never delete data, then, it's only a question of How much time and effort does it take on your end to restore some, users data especially when there's not a complex interaction between the data rights\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:16 ): You may, yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:16 ): where it's, I can't reconcile this prosperous and it's like, We can't really actually tell what you tried to do here with this, It's really well. They typed in some prompt, even the AI We can even recreate what the AI does, right? I\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:16 ): He?",

  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:16 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:16 ): it will be by practice. We just don't have that complex of the site.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:16 ): Yeah, the other thing is invalidate.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:16 ): No, I",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:16 ): We won't do this because the sessions go through the database, everything, but just as an idea,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:16 ): We?",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:16 ): you can also just sort of invalidate at log every user out. Right before you do the migration, And then prevent user logins that aren't, one of us, That's another way to kind of create some window where it's like, Okay only we can use the site the guy do manual testing of production.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:16 ): .",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:16 ): But we don't need to do any of that in practice. At this point. I was gonna kind of leave. Moses is up to you. basically hack together to get an extra release with just the features that you've already started, which is funny. And",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:16 ): Yeah, there's all good things like connecting it with this thing, but correctional, socket down to test it and\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:16 ): Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:16 ): and then that thing when the essence that is once it sends back to the socket or not cket that thing. another thing I need to check pretty much all things like, all the errors, which we are noted on our work, done the other six issues which are very done. So that thing has been sorted out.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:16 ): That.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:16 ): I did that thing. And the migration also went smoothly for the testing or the developments. So only this thing is remaining, what is the soccer thing? So after soccer, we will test it with the I think, change the Change\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:16 ): Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:16 ): what you say. Change the parameters and then point accordingly. And they are server so that gets proper than we can roll out.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:16 ): Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:16 ): All do the changes properly not production. You want Sure? I guess because I mentioning.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:16 ): I know, We'll just do that together.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:16 ): Yeah,\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:16 ): Once you got everything right, Mmm.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:16 ): I'm maintaining separate branch for this thing like the current thing so it will not mix it. Until I ended, we do not test it ourselves and this in the developments,",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:16 ): And then the pipeline also, the script is written like that today that if this is the branch which we are using push it to this thing and the other chair running of the script in this way in the government machine and if it isn't production in this branch, then do it in the production. So we don't own right. And all the changes are going on.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:16 ): And in one place. I got stuck in my pipeline at that time, but I forgot the branches That's what it was not taking up. The video was from the environments. Otherwise all thing was great proper the pipeline issue was getting up. Before he comes that And That thing is that. And they all commitments have been done because in the front desk for backup today love and daily chart subject. This is the thing.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:16 ): Guys.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:16 ): good. Yeah yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:16 ): Yeah, I have changed in the \u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:16 ): off you can change it yet, email it.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:21 ): I changed it. I'm not if I pass here then it will come in that thing also the file. But then the remote machine, I've changed that the email to me and it is showing me this thing. Current. I don't have any chance yesterday, right? Then he showed this thing,\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:21 ): Mmm.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:21 ): the JSON format, this now because I did not send any message because then point I've been changed or you can see",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:21 ): The API. Handles on the chart. sorry, about",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:21 ): That. And yeah, this thing is that. Okay conversation it is and it is now API conversations and for receiving also get something At all. Yeah, I get on Saturday dislike.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:21 ): Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:21 ): so, That session, add Brownie and reply. Yeah this photo. So I had problem will call the AI server and it will pass that early conversation. I didn't prompt and in reply We need this thing. Conversationary prompt was if I reply wash your place to replace your first. All this parameters And reply from the answer.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:21 ): Mmm.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:21 ): Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:21 ): So The AI will also send that endpoint only AI send and conversations last year since I said, and it will send the replying that thing. Yeah, this is the important.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:21 ): so, Yeah,\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:21 ): all right, I talk about",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:21 ): to reply got no this much parameter Right? Later our conversation.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:21 ): Yeah, okay good, that's it. I can look at that in the",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:21 ): and I had to plan air from this tour, the things you can look for",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:21 ): So I assume that was the other thing reply Replica. It's kind of interesting breakdown. by prompt cost input token.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:21 ): yeah. Yeah, the importance, whether",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:21 ): Because the shower. Yeah, I mean the trick is Right? Because we're doing multi-stage. Prompting all the future stages all have input tokens, right? And then the reply. So for example the HTML has input tokens as well, and output tokens. Right.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:21 ): yeah, I mean",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:21 ): Yeah, the question is what these are? These are the fields you have In the database, right? Basically all the way the database,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:21 ): Yeah. Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:21 ): yeah, that's fine. What we'll do is prompt cost will basically just be total input token's.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:21 ): That you can say, yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:21 ): Reply costs will be like total output tokens.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:21 ): Yeah, not always sure if we've been used, it was separate out there. I'm just gonna because there's no separation of input and output with HTML.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:21 ): Yeah, for now maybe I'll just include everything In reply all the output tokens including to generate the HTML in just reply costs and all the input tokens including and generate the HTML in prompt costs and just not really use the",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:21 ): The other ideas. Yeah. If this is gonna be token count instead of dollar amount, I mean against tricky, two, or it might be mixing What type is the field in the database for these costs,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:21 ): It's like number on America 10.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:21 ): is it Number.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:21 ): Best of again the similar Maybe I can change that to that thing\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:21 ): Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:21 ): but didn't say call anybody.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:21 ): Yeah, just yeah. This is",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:21 ): Is the real question is what are? Because I mean, there's one flexible person to say have these be string or, basically json that way we can actually include more complicated ideas but the reality is, it doesn't really matter the user isn't directly.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:21 ): The question is, how we got to figure out How do we want this accounting to be seen by the user, right? Because if it's not user facing, The question is,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:21 ): No, it's not as surfacing.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:21 ): how are we?",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:21 ): Actually, we want this thing. Not like, how are the usages going on? And we also get that here understanding how much to opens are going to use actually?",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:21 ): Yeah. Yeah, that's something I get this point. I'd rather have something than nothing. and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:26 ): ",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:26 ): you've already made these changes. Leave it like this and then",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:26 ): You wanted to enumeric only then you say because currently I'm not adding anything and it's in the development so we can change that field, particularly",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:26 ): Yeah, somebody let's talk it through you. The good numeric allows you to much more easily. Write a query that accumulates, like sums all them just in postgres, They gives more flexibility for us to actually be able to say, okay for each stage. For example, how many input tokens are being used? How many output tokens are being used, right? That makes sense because then we can really break it down. This is an example where I mean, I'm kind of leaning towards the idea that actually keeping it simple. In the database is gonna give us flexibility down the road. We're actually cost is just a single feel. And it's type.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:26 ): Do they have a JSON type Which is effectively string under the hood but I think you post guys.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:26 ): And why you want Jsonia like we can",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:26 ): Will because but we want to modify we want to actually be able to change the structure of the underlying data. Without updating the database.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:26 ): meaning",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:26 ): Meaning, let's say we go for having five stages of the prompt to having seven stages of the prompt. We want to actually break down the cost by each state by having a key, which is the name of that particular state, Or the trick is, if we have numeric, we'd actually have to go in and change the schema of the database. In fact, now we have six fields in the database, input token costs for better prompting input Output token for better,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:26 ): Are going to go to it.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:26 ): right input? Okay. You need with JSON is,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:26 ): I got The stage wise breaking of the tokens of the cost,\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:26 ): yeah, it's flexible.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:26 ): Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:26 ): should we are? Yeah, then today I will look that thing it's not a big deal. but how many stages and whether that we don't know, that's what like, we know, but in this thing,",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:26 ): We know this. But yeah, this comes under more of the flexibility as we go generally, right? This was getting out last time with this idea of sometimes these fields, if you make them very specific types, Like numeric,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:26 ): Hey.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:26 ): they actually are very restrictive. And then it's like, every time you want to add some information, you have to update the scheme of the database which takes more work. the beauty of put the modern versions of postgres starting with that's a while ago now, but three or four versions ago, they actually have ways to basically say, they have a JSON data type, which is the end of the day. Means it's storing. Yeah. And they have JSON B, which is binary JSON.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:26 ): Meaning.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:26 ): It was eventually say Okay.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:26 ): Because of Jason types are exact copy of the input tax. It will preserve some magician. So we basically is like text but then you can queries on Yeah,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:26 ): there's,",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:26 ): fields within it. And the trick is the performance of those queries is kind of like the way Mongo works, right? Because at the end of the day it can know the size of everything. Do these highly performing queries but you still can do I know that this JSON thing is like an object that has fields which basically name all the phases, let's say. And then each has some fields called input and output. Let's say you still write a query that's sum up all the input tokens. But then if you go from five phases to 20 phases and change the name of the phases, those queries still work. Exactly the same way and the schema doesn't change and the reality is the fact that it's not really high performance.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:26 ): Is fine because you're not going to be doing, the type of query over the entire database for that type of query. Right? You're gonna basically say Okay this is also where with postgres You can write arbitrary Python postgres, has a Python interpreter built into the actual database. And again this is where the performance you can really get into a problem that it's like blocking the database if you make it super complex, but for something like If you're doing batch cost analysis, Type of thing, you can really go in and write these complicated queries that are like,",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:26 ): For example, if we're estimating the cost and we're wrong from an top but it's not atomic, right? We say basically Don't do this atomically,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:26 ): .",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:31 ): It's probably not the end of the world, because if we're off by one broth by a hundred tokens and we're giving the user a budget of a million or 10 million tokens per month and we're temporarily about 500 tokens and we run it that night. Let's say and then it corrects them by a hundred tokens. Oops, we either, we're all 500 tokens, this is not a big deal and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:31 ): I mean.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:31 ): so that's where we want to maintain the right flexibility. And in this case, at the very least, I don't think those are the correct. If we're going to use numerics, I think we just want two numeric input tokens and output tokens and then make the AI, do the summing of all.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:31 ): and no, no, I will give the juice something like Because that is why.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:31 ): Yeah, the JSON is worth it because that allow yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:31 ): Yeah, we will know which stages consuming more tokens and\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:31 ): Exactly.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:31 ): what is happening at each stage stabilizer.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:31 ): Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:31 ): Later, if we increase the stage, you can also have the flexibility to increase it.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:31 ): Yeah, yeah. And it reduces the sort of tight coupling between the AI. We don't really want this idea of these two. The AI being isolated isn't really true if suddenly every time we change the database, schema we're actually updating interview, the AI code to output those fields. This is gonna be nice because basically, We have some general, format, that's return an object where each, entry has input and output. and For now, the beauty is for the actual schema change. You just have to change the type. Yeah, I would just have a single thing called cost at that type JSON. And I wouldn't even worry about the buy the JSON, B. I mean, it doesn't really matter. I don't think in the sense that we're not super worried about performance. These are small JSON up.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:31 ): yeah, I didn't number It did not take that much it's not big line not like paragraphs and\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:31 ): I guess is for Debacility.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:31 ): Mm-hmm",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:31 ): on his simple yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:31 ): Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:31 ): And that thing",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:31 ): Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:31 ): What was the community?",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:31 ): The other one Have a weight. Okay, The other field to actually add, is at a latency field because when I realized is it's not the database during the time, stamp will be okay if we wanted to capture the total elapsed time but in this way it allows to do the same thing and basically have the AI keep its own time stamps, just put that in a JSON object and then return that for all those stages.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:31 ): Response. And",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:31 ): And I would just call the field latency. I mean, that'll be really easy to work with Easier to\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:31 ): But yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:31 ): And that would like, what do we care about costly? And that's pretty universal and AI that's your trade-off and that we just have those two fields as JSON, and it lets us be really flexible as we go.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:31 ): Latency latest.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:31 ): Yeah, each stage, we can do this. Yeah, but just keep waiting, as a json. That way we can be flexible.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:31 ): Yeah. Or.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:31 ): For reply. Do you want us something like that? You're expecting?",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:31 ): The thing, it will enter inside. Yeah, don't divide it into prompter reply because the whole point is the prompt is just with the user put in right?",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:31 ): Promptness. Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:31 ): And so there's No And therefore,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:31 ): Promptness. Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:31 ): everything implicitly is actually about the reply even the input tokens while they are the.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:31 ): Yeah, that's a",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:31 ): So I would just have costly and see and add another field actually, which we can call",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:31 ): It's really AI metadata or something like that or maybe just met it, which is also JSON. And with that allow us to do is more flexible. for example, I want to say for each stage, which model did we use if we're using different models for different stage or other just ad hoc information about that stages work. It'll allow us to not have to update the schema right to actually then have the front end application. Use that we bet you can say yeah no we want to display to the user. For example, the name of what phase it's working on, right? I dump it into this metadata object and then the user interface uses the metadata object, or bypassing the database schema Right, that makes sense. By just having JSON okay does it let's take a step back,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:31 ): once more, I got the idea the metadata thing\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:31 ): is it? Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:31 ): but anything like you're dealing area,\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:31 ): So don't feel called metadata.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:36 ): real-time thinking will happen or with that thing like whenever any stage responsibility gets added there and then we send it.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:36 ): That's just one example. The idea is anything. We're gonna use in the future. Any feature can basically use. Sometimes I'll even put a field called other or\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:36 ): Okay. Yeah. Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:36 ): additional data. This is Something like that with the beauty is a catch all that allows you to bypass the whole concept of the schema in postgres\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:36 ): I",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:36 ): which you're seeing why it It's like he was all the safety of a schema and you got different data formats, but the fact that you just be like, Hey, we updated the UI. And then we updated the bat. I think it's like, Okay now we're showing that data and then a lot of times because this is what I kind of prefer is start by just dumping the data into some general JSON field and then later when we find that either the queries aren't performant or we're getting messy data or something, promote that piece of data into its own field, right?",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:36 ): know.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:36 ): Joseph, you have a lot of people startups actually, like using Mongo because at the end of the day, you get yourself into a lot of nastiness, but you're going just to be okay? It's just a document, just give the data and then you don't change the database at all. And sequel is so brittle. Where when you're actually changing the schema, You just paying to do and so unless you're really saying my God I just want to be able to enforce these timestamps certain things where it is useful.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:36 ): Yeah, so yeah, cost latency than one other field, that's like a catch all that we can kind of use to and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:36 ): Yeah, and\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:36 ): we'll start. Since. Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:36 ): latency. Not only just on the android or with this one and to comment or\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:36 ): Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:36 ): open thing will be also do something. and yeah, the thing is that",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:36 ): social club, not So good.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:36 ): There are larger.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:36 ): but,",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:36 ): Almost everything there about fruit, like it should.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:36 ): I said, again. That's right.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:36 ): The other field.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:36 ): yeah yeah. Do the same thing. Make that json that way and at an airfield. Yeah. That'll be good. Yeah, they can flexible.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:36 ): Will start. I mean.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:36 ): I got this thing. For five, six days.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:36 ): Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:36 ): Yeah this thing will work. Yeah. My but that was having one idea on this thing like the forecast and all these things like Are you guys Any YouTube videos are any video format. he's telling this thing. Got He has some prompts you want to run break the transcript into smaller gems. What is the context link 4096 words, character limit type of thing. Break the transcript into those chunks. He has his own problems. You want to run this prompts and get you can say somebody or some kind of things on all that chance and then use that chance and\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:36 ): Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:36 ): create a mind map kind of thing.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:36 ): Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:36 ): And also if you want, then this thing, second part will be the video thing for content content, generation type of thing. which then we read, I guess is doing that thing. So he has that particular pipeline type of thing. He has in his mind he wondered the idea is that this Pope of this thing like in ten dollar or something like that, which we can type in the US market, if he runs that and all the stuff for this thing,",
  "01 (2024-09-25 15:36 ): 00:00",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:36 ): Yeah yeah I mean so okay that's basically was talking about with doing this talk. Yeah. So the trick\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:36 ): Yeah, he's yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:36 ): though is instead of outputting video because outputting video is the expensive part instead basically saying output a website from the discussion, So this idea of being like here, we talked through what we want. And bam, it just generates that because that's gonna be in our real house right to do the same idea though. The trick with the chunking though is this where the embedding comes in, right? Because the sheer volume of. So for example, our chat logs, over we have about, something like 50 pages per chat, 2500 pages. it comes out to almost half a million tokens of us just us talking,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:36 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:36 ): And so even with doing the 4k chunking, if you actually run those through models right now and the one and this is what I was talking about the guy, it's like",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:36 ): Organization. The mind This idea of carrying knowledge graphs for basically What are we talk about is what a lot of these other tools like Otter ai kind of does the challenge though is and when I was on the FLAVIUS was like It's not that useful because it's one thing.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:36 ): Which one thing to say, we talked about this idea so other people can see what we talked about, then it can kind of be useful, but it's the one thing that you actually kind of. Remember from the talks is these big ideas of what you talked about are the threats.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:36 ): yeah, that",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:36 ): It's also the obvious one, we're gonna be okay, we can turn what I know into a good thing, the trick is, and also The amount of output tokens becomes really, really large. Because you either over summarize stuff or\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:36 ): yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:36 ): You're like, wait, I'm trying to summarize, 2500 pages of content, generate a hundred pages that I'm gonna read those hundred pages. So what I found is that saying when I'm using the summarize button that they put at the top is the least useful. Right? Yeah,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:36 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:36 ): and so what I found is what I did the call with Lisa so yeah we didn't really need to summarize it, I had specific ideas.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:36 ): That I needed to extract from by asking and prompting those questions and the challenge with rag. And so would you really need to do is say and this is going to work on the next week is kind of said Okay we take this huge corpus of conversations. But first we dumped that this raw into chroma right we generate embeddings from them\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:36 ): ",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:36 ): because that's a lot cheaper and then we go ahead and the chunk size generally is a lot smaller than the 4k you're talking about chunks of maybe each paragraph. So you're kind of a hundred tokens and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:36 ): yeah, maybe",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:36 ): then extracting I mean turn that into one number and then you're doing that rag search, you're like okay, pull in the base, anything that relates into these longer context, and then do those techniques are like, fusion summarization in a context, dependent way. What I think is actually required, is to do this in two phases, you keep those raw transcripts, right? And you have, references to those documents and then you do another pass of",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:36 ): Be ingesting interact. Along this lines of these mind maps of, okay, I don't want to know the raw transcript. Now I want and I don't want just a summarization, I want something that's topic use case oriented over Go through the whole history of three months and let's find all the cases where they talked about Web sockets and Poland. For example, That's the one. I think I'm gonna do for the talk, then actually, comprehensively",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:36 ): Rewrite pretty long documents, right? years are guide to what we talked with polling and Web sockets that is still time stamp. So it's like on Thursday, they talked about, May 27, they talked about this and then on this date, they talked about this. The turns into a narrative specific to, what were their thoughts on Websockets? What were their thoughts on video in AI, And so physically kind of go through and do instead of summarization Like topic extraction, Cover the list of every topic that they talked about over those three months, right? And now Orthogonally, Go back and reconstruct these new documents feed those into rag and add additional metadata. So for each chunk, you're also putting in, What topic does this topics Does this have to do with what would the actionable items, like what other, change eventual topics, really just relate to or other metadata and that way that metadata is",
  "01 (2024-09-25 15:36 ): 05:00",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:36 ): in the embeddings as well. So that in the next, then when you actually go and ask questions of the data that are more, complex I want something that's more like this. I go in and I typed something okay,",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:36 ): How is pricing, What's the pricing of the app that they're building, or\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:36 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:36 ): some title question, What are they doing? And then it divides into this timeline. So I actually want to generate more like timeline oriented HTML graphs and stuff that are like for this month, they worked on security and proposal writing and then they worked on a museum, minimum viable product. And then They're really, work on this. And then it's like, what were all the pricing? or How much time did they spend focused on getting into production versus development first? When did they talk about security or I want to be able to ask this question? how paranoid was Steve about security at different points in time in the graph?",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:36 ): Yeah. Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:36 ): Should really show this my God, for the first month, the way he talked about security was like,",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:36 ): Very detailed and there's a lot talking about security and it was like, my gosh, even depend on any library at all and then we need to release this MVP and then here were these security or even better is something like Take the owass top 10 and then go through three months of conversation and find problem areas where what they decided whether it was even implemented that way, was like that, or then that, and then also something open the repo, go to the git repo and say, Okay, were there any cases where they didn't build, what they said, they were gonna build? Right? Are there any cases where they built actually is violate some of the principles.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:36 ): Now.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:36 ): They talked about what will cause problems. So those get trickier. So I think the trick is Why are you having these conversations? What does the transcript represent? And then kind of saying, what is our goal here to kind of Get out of this?",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:36 ): It's use case if we're talking about. Okay? We're developers building an actual thing. It's actually kind of straightforward that we can look at the thing we can look at we talked about and it's difficult but it's at least reasonable to figure it out for something like interviews for journalists, right?",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:36 ): it's sort of like, okay, we can still kind of do the same, What topics are they talk about here? Was there what are the right ideas to write articles about? And kind of do that, you're not with a client. It's much more specific details of did we promise anything to the client that we haven't done? when it's time to do, are there any deadlines that came up in the call? So I think as opposed to sort of summarization which then puts an onus on the person is still be, like, Wait. Now I've got to read all these summaries, it does this help and the flip side is, I think even going a step further of saying The transcript is okay, but it doesn't have a feedback loop because it's not short enough latency. you have I want conversation, you get the transcript and hour later and then you can do something with it. So it's good for that. Long term idea would",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:36 ): But this is where using the whisper API are kind of being like, Okay, I talked for a minute and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:36 ): Wow.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:36 ): then maybe I have to add Bill, what I said. And then I see what that is. Then we talk for another minute and that doesn't exactly fit into Google me, trans idea. But it's something like the Whisper API. is reasonable, but requires a little more work to actually, as early, there's a use case where we basically,",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:36 ): Again this right kind of want to think through with this application, as we move it forward, does it just look like chat? Or Does the whole way the user interacts with it kind of fundamentally different? I do think there's something to be said for It is just listening all the time type of approach and it requires two people to actually be talking because I don't think a person talks to AI the same way they talk when there's another human being, right? It's weird.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:36 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:36 ): You telling it what to do. It's just kind of like talking about stuff but people you just got to talk about stuff and then Yeah is listening and doing what you're talking about in sort of the seamless, kind of thing. and the tricky report too is it's like if you don't glue you don't connect directly to the video conferencing, it's a tricky to get both sides of the conversation, right?",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:36 ): You can do it by basically saying, you both have to be running the application but it requires that coordinate for example, What if we had? No, Okay, We use Google Meet for the actual call, and then we both have to have chat open and both have to enable the microphone but then connecting those two streams, it with the transit was kind of nice. You get the back and forth better. but even say, maybe you include the video conferencing directly in the application. Maybe you do it The other way around making it plug in a Google Me or Skype whatever the tools are in zoom and\u2026",
  "01 (2024-09-25 15:36 ): 10:00",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:36 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:36 ): stuff. So I think there's a lot of different ways to figure out. how are you actually capturing that audio? The other one is a transcription quality itself even have open AI or of Google. Meet is actually not that great if you feel needs to capture very specific words, the reason why it works so well with",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:36 ): Long-term thing is generally kind of things get repeated right?",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:36 ): Love. And",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:36 ): Or things are rephrase or the other person has fall questions and it prevents so much context for the text ai. That's doing the summarization type of idea to like, I saw you said that three times and one of the three times it picked it up correctly and this other time that it camp was super weird language. there's background noise or something like, okay. Just doesn't get included and it works fine.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:36 ): No, that's another interesting thing which is like, Yeah, we don't want people just chatting because I don't think that's the way to get the most productivity and I do think audio is kind of the trick. It's like, I actually don't think video. I don't watch a lot of YouTube videos. I think video not a great format for mostly anything that's up here, but it's a great program for storytelling.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:36 ): That's about it and the reason\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:36 ): Yeah, I did it.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:36 ): why it's a great because a very passive, and so audio on the other hand, just, it's like, it can be about direct communication. It could be capturing someone's voice and therefore, they're expressing their ideas, And the other idea is sort of like and this part that isn't the audio generally. Stuff like a website or something you're dynamically interacting with or a game Frankly. I mean, I think the other big one we games and this idea, a decade ago, I was really working on, games was more like",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:36 ): Games are so difficult to build, but I don't know if you're playing games very much but the user interfacing games has to be incredible because it is the whole point, there's nothing else, right? User doesn't feel like they're immersed \u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:36 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:36 ): What's the? You're not gonna sell that game. It's not fun, And much of user interface for Web applications and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:36 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:36 ): even like video which is very passive. It's missing this idea of the power. There's always a kind aesthetic power of feeling really connected to a system in an interactive way and games I mean typically take years to develop right I mean there are and they're small even like Triple A games that cost tens of millions of dollars to produce the actual surface of interaction is not super big. I mean, they typically have a small finite set of core user interactions that,",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:36 ): I really, really fun core game mechanics, Or even one core game mechanic that a developer kind of like hones in, to kind of get to be really really tight. And then the the player is interacting with that. Core game mechanic in these variations on a theme sort of a way if it's Mario it's like running and jumping that is the entire game and not just one game that is an entire genre and game that has lasted for decades and even when you get and then you take a first person shooter it's like there's really only one thing like You can have this many different games and different Web all the time. There's just one thing the user's been doing for 30 years but it's really, really tightly designed to have this feedback people saying, This is, real-time strategy games. if you try to make them too complex, the users I'm not learning in that kindness that it kind of way and I do think that's where again",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:36 ): This comes to that original idea. I was talking about that the power of AI is that it's this tremendous force multiplier that allows you to deviate from the mean because you have a different cost function of Of exploring alternative ideas cheap. Then suddenly, I can try something that isn't guaranteed to work ahead of time. The challenge then becomes, how do you take a data-driven discipline? and allow it to cost-effectively, explore something that is far from the mean, and by doing that by having that a good example that ground truth and games is actually tricky, How do we create an automatic feedback loop that sort of like, without a lot of user testing identifies? This interaction is actually fun and this interaction is not fun.",
  "01 (2024-09-25 15:36 ): 15:00",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:36 ): And for game developers it's usually like will the developer themselves. Doesn't really need other users to identify that they know when they see it because they themselves feel it and they feel connected and immersed into the game, right? And So it's still as human.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:36 ): Yeah, I",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:36 ): And the question of alignment choose this other big idea, which is How do you make sure what we're building is serving humans? maintaining this idea of individuality, right where our goal isn't to align with everybody because that sort of again, just reverts to that mean. The goal is to say, How do you build something that's testable? That is statistical at the same time is allowing an individual person to efficiently express.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:36 ): Even though it's difficult for them to express, they don't even know themselves, Or can articulate themselves, what they really want and not just giving people superficially kind of what they want. In the moment, social media is the ultimate just like addictive BS, I mean, it's so driven by okay, we've busy, follow the data, implicitly of sort of what people want and, what's gonna release a little bit of dopamine into their brain. And it was just produced the hell out of that because we know it works well, and you have influencers that What is the value here of So I don't know. And so I think the challenges and something has more depth to it. It doesn't have that one of the instant gratification it's harder to say, How do we measure",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:36 ): something that has a distance to it. the finger pointing at the moon, kind of idea. How do we measure that in a way that then allows feedback? And I think the answer generally is you have to actually construct complex systems sort of by construction. And then it's get down the idea If I want to know if a Web development is actually good like a certain technique for web development, it's not enough to just build some website because there's all these concerns like security that are very very hard to unless it's perfect So the trick is, if you want to you got to prove it like you've got to go all the way down to the metal and prove. The thing is a hundred percent correct because with a hundred percent solution you then can actually start getting that force multiplier and then say it's cheaper to do the hundred percent solution once you've invested in that, but it is to do the 90% solution with a human.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:36 ): Is a 90% solution. You need the human more in the loop, And they're not simply expressing.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:36 ): There are alignment preferences, they're expressing how to do it, And that's never gonna kind of spin up into this thing. The reality is right now, the AI is so expensive that it's very difficult to effectively get down to that ground truth, Because you can't just run the model a million times kind of thing. that's the future, which is if my model is doing in context learning but even need a model, the size for a mini, but even the seven B model or we talking about a really trained. one B model that is actually the end game in which case I might running that a zillion times, and iteratively and doing more like code generation. We're not even using models, ironically I do think that's the future too, which it's not so much for doing the thing directly so language model writing code that does",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:36 ): Thing because once you want determinism you really don't want to language model in the first place. So the language model becomes the scaffolding to kind of build this beautiful walk of code. That's perfect and gigantic and no human could ever write that really just directly all these problems, If you if you want to solve a problem architecture, fluid mechanics or something, like, I don't think you can do without language funnels. And also don't think the Final Solution has much language model and right, I mean or even data model except where there's some non-linear statistical problem.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:36 ): Deeply embedded within that domain which case you've matched that, an extra boost model is going directly to that within the domain, If I'm trying to simulate wind on a bridge or something, sure maybe I have some data model\u2026",
  "01 (2024-09-25 15:36 ): 20:00",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:36 ): On.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:36 ): but that's where I'm not like running it at some, Empiricism has its place when empiricism does and rationality as sort of the counter to empiricism is what's hard to include in sort of a data science perspective, But it hasn't gone away. it's hot or not I think the challenges a lot of these things like They're just very difficult to actually solve, right? And without resources to explore, a lot of different areas.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:36 ): Woman.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:36 ): I don't know what. And so,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:36 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:36 ): yeah, I mean it's not exactly worried because I think the other part I realized is there's just a view with technology that sort of this race right to be the first mover, it's like, what's gonna happen? Is ai is Going to pass us by or, type of thing. But the reality is like the underlying technology just become better. And so if you're a little bit ahead of the curve, in terms of your thinking, you just have to then be patient for the curve to catch up to If you're thinking about something that's like the problem with that is it's too expensive. That's the right problem to have because it just means that you're kind of just waiting for these other companies to spend their capital to build underlying solutions, right?",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:36 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:36 ): I like that's not the worst problem to have as opposed to the opposite of always trying to have something that's the most advanced in the marketplace at every moment which means that you're always living exactly in that moment which is the traditional MVP lean startup type of approach but the reality is Who's too quickly to actually have that be super effective from a customer perspective. Right? Customers are struggling to figure out How do I really use AI and they're changing every couple months, And so I think it's a following that we're still in that moment where it's like",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:36 ): You're gonna see just these AI companies and raise a lot of money just imploding because they spend all the money and then they're on the treadmill and customers just move on to something else that like that. You did that thing. That was the state of the art of year ago and you release bunch of papers and so if you're spending that cap it's for the reason why I don't think Despite me a lot of times that without raising money, we can't do x y or\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:36 ): very,",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:36 ): It still doesn't make sense to raise money and then do X y and Z. Because I don't those become like Yeah,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:36 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:36 ): if you really want to compete with Openai and Anthropic, that's one thing. But you're talking about In the 50 billion dollar kind of which is just not reasonable. Even for all these startups, even companies like Mistral.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:36 ): Even companies, if you're not exactly opening Iran, traffic one of the big tech companies, like meta or something exactly what's the strategy here? Some ANOVA or grock right? They raise $700 million dollars I think they're just gonna burn through 700 million dollars, it's gonna really talk.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:36 ): Why?",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:36 ): How they actually get back, the return. I think the reality too is, maybe they'll be fine. The founders will have some companies that makes 20 million dollars a year.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:36 ): Because they find some angle. That's right. because they have interaction customers and I figure something out, but the reality is it's a lot of years if you have 20 million dollars in revenue and even three or four million dollars in profit to actually provide a return on 700 million and 700 million with a hurdle rate of 35% means you can never pay that back. Unless somebody you become like Nvidia and even in video there,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:36 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:36 ): they can't sustain their stock price because reality is you can't sell that many chips for that. Sustained a period of time. people are just gonna suddenly find ways to use the chips have already bought, they're not gonna need generation after generation of chips at the Same volume. No.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:36 ): Yeah. Yeah, I was a stop there. there was not launching any new GPS and on stuff and\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:36 ): Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:36 ): otherwise they were a few months back against six to seven months back. They were in that more after three, four months. And you do what's going into the market? And I was taking up and all the air companies were jumping into buying this machines for training the data.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:36 ): I mean, only the thing is, there's a 100 and the h100. they're released other GPUs that are smaller, but those aren't very meaningful, right? they don't really matter in the marketplace and the reality was, the a100 h, 100 were about a year apart, And the a100 was at fp8, Footing point eight. And then the H1 to floating point four right up before. So that's this big shift that in really improves efficiency, but the reality is when we saw these paper ACM or from IEEE on more the semiconductor side and you can't really go below fp4. So the average quantization is too bits per parameter.",
  "01 (2024-09-25 15:36 ): 25:00",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:36 ): And so the average information in large models since two bits per parameter. But partially that's because they're under train, still for the size of the model to make training a little bit more. Efficient even while I'm at 3.1 was they still arbitrarily had to stop the training? At some point. It was not because they weren't seeing any continued learning happen even at 15 trillion tokens. And so there's this need to kind of at least on the training side have four bit quantization. And by the time when you think of four bits, it's like if I have one bit for sign",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:36 ): And then I have one bit to represent, an exponent. I've only got two left going below. So you get two bit quantization. they're only four values, but it's actually hard to. Yeah, it's kind of small. and anything is not a power of two. Just generally is never the most efficient in hardware. I mean that's, kind of how hard works with log base 2 stuff and so what you see is like okay they can't architecturally really change much at this point also Moore's law kind of ended. So the real question you might be able to increase the density of",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:36 ): Of transistors going to 1.8 these are these more advanced process. but you really can't increase the power density accordingly because You're already eating this thermal limit with these trips. And then the memory bandwidth are already using Hpm2 and saturating it. And as you increase clock frequency you also increase power Use it, So suddenly My guess is We've actually hit the wall, We're like not to say they won't release more GPUs,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:36 ): but,",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:36 ): But GPUs will suddenly become very marginal improvements and actually become more architecturally specific and particularly with Nvidia has so much cash and they have to figure out how to differentiate it. I think what you're gonna see is They might actually say something, we build a llama specific check",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:36 ): because they can",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:36 ): And then I do that devices like laptops and\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:36 ): Yeah. Yeah,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:36 ): all the stuff.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:36 ): and then maybe do that maybe just sell directly to Meta and to data centers, Because for the Llama 400b model, they might build a chip. That's actually designed with the clustering in mind, for that exact model size, To be super competitive in Data Center with open and traffic and lower cost, So that it's kind of reasonable where you might say for ten thousand dollars.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:36 ): But I think this is the whole point they're gonna be forced to lower their costs one way or the other, right? I just think that's the reality and they're gonna need to figure out a way to keep selling you trips. They can't just say We're gonna sell the h100 for another decade and I think what you're seeing is lavas becoming pretty dominant in the downstream fine-tuning. If you don't want to use these proprietary models, there's no other company that's doing the level of training of the foundational model.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:36 ): To me.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:36 ): So Mistral is getting good results but they're getting good results by doing a lot of More advanced stuff that isn't necessarily well suited to this myriad of fine-tuning. Thick right. Whereas lava is just like, we just bought 200,000 h100 and are train just, training on a sheer volume of tokens across a lot of breath.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:36 ): So, I don't know, you'll see something happening in that market. That'll be kind of interesting,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:36 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:36 ): but I think it's gonna be again. Yeah, this sort of all these companies are raised a bunch of money now bought GPUs in the really really expensive or bought time for fine, too. I mean, a digital ocean just out of the h100, not in paper space, but in the core like offerings, you can actually go to the digital ocean, gooey and back. I want an 800, the cluster which is what you would need to train to do fine-tuning of the llama 3.1 70 B model. It's 47, dollars an hour. Which the 750 hours in",
  "01 (2024-09-25 15:36 ): 30:00",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:36 ): .",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:36 ): in a CPU month, basically they round to 750 hours, that's 40,000. Is it 40,000 a month.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:36 ): To rent,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:36 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:36 ): a cluster to do training. I mean, that's insane. I mean again if you're some coming, right? Yeah. We just raised 20 30 million dollars and that's what we're gonna spend it on. I think you're gonna struggle in a year to say How do we actually hold on It's an asset that depreciates within months and actually seems like a bad business model",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:36 ): So I think what this idea of we need to just, focus on use cases and then be pretty opinionated about the solutions within those areas and then get demonstrable we need killer apps that are very demonstrable. We're in just be okay. Here's Use case that you actually use. And here's this cool thing that just does it and you don't care about how it does it, right? you just works and for us I mean, in terms of the Web stack, This is where the question too is Do we really want our Web stack to be as complex as we currently have it? because one is of a human has to do it even post postgres for example.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:36 ): we're shifting even today towards just Why don't we just have some fields in JSON, Why don't we have this be a little more flexible and we have to say, doesn't even make sense to actually use postgres forever. Right is post-grade. on the one hand with a human it's gives a lot of safety of doing certain things that we kind of know. We're relying on the database We can write queries in the future that work, But let's say we really have AI doing all of this Yeah, taking our covid. What is you Why really even have that database layer? Why not just say when we have a new scale problem with create a bespoke solution to that scale problem then in simulate or useful verification.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:36 ): To prove in the same way that people who create databases do, There's no race conditions and that there's a guaranteed to be atomic or that, the transactions are item code or whatever kind of guarantees that he'd be made the database level. So now, the database is no longer at database. It's like a guide to how to create hoc databases, right? So I mean that gets to this whole idea which it makes sense to do stuff ad hoc and in the history of programming it's always been a risk deserve reinvent. The wheel in some ad hoc way, right? but the question isn't that the whole promise of AI and it can just do it ad hoc and put in the resources to prove that it's correct and make the ad hoc thing as robust as the non ad hoc like commodity thing so anyway, Those are my thoughts on it.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:36 ): Robotics. But they are.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:36 ): Yeah, then we can meet on Friday, I guess.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:36 ): Yeah, sounds good.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:36 ): And that time mostly through the socket was then we might push it in the production.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:36 ): Yeah, yeah, we get it done. and yeah, if you need more time, just, email me and We don't\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:36 ): Yeah. Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:36 ): if you whichever way and it. Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:36 ): Because when the socket gets properly connected and all and see how it goes when the network get disconnected and how is the connection status. That does stuff really big or that thing in the past testing thing. Then it'll be great for us. That is the main thing. Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-25 15:36 ): That sounds good. All right.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-25 15:36 ): Okay, see you.",

  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:17 ): Yeah yeah it was funny. I was working on it I was testing out my back this morning and changing a few things. And then as I was doing that I realized, okay you're probably making changes because the logo.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:17 ): You are.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:17 ): Yeah And the whiteboard was even the mobile I looked at the responsive design and I was like it scrolls over and then Five minutes later I checked again and I was like, Wait this works. How did this happen? And then Now that makes sense that you're yeah.",

  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:22 ): Yeah, yeah, so we'll look at that. hopefully for the new messages I added more aggressive commands. I just did all caps three times in a row escape this we'll see for future messages. Does a better job of the real is most of the time it actually does escape it. if you do a simple query where you're right some HTML, it'll be in the pre-tag correctly, it tends to be when you ask for something kind of more complex or it then adds those script and style tags and they make it in there. Cool.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:22 ): Yeah. One more day,\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:22 ): Yeah, walk you through. changes yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:22 ): one wasn't. I was now wondering about the Web worker thing. If I work very supported, we will do that within the back. Something like that. I was thinking, Web worker,\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:22 ): Say that Web workers for What?",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:22 ): Web worker. Yeah. Perfecting all the fetch calls which are taking place. Currently the polling thing We supported, Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:22 ): the pulp. What's just go to website? I mean I think we're gonna do that was just use Web sockets and just do it right? Web workers is more good when you actually need to do something that is inherently computational expensive. So not so much async type of work but work where there's rendering something where you actually want to, use CPU to draw to or do audio processing. Something where, the beauty of The anon blocking approach is It works great when it's very Io, heavy and driven user interface tends to be like that. Where it's almost like hot potato. It's like, Okay, I get a message that I just pass that onto something else in the browser. Any of the real work is done by these brows APIs, that then don't block user thread and then the browser takes care of multiple processes. So you're rendering the actual pain? Yes, that's an images.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:22 ): On it has to do real work in the CPU,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:22 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:22 ): but it's kind of hidden from the user thread behind the scenes and then So it's a task space approach and then node kind of takes that approach as well. The back end kind of does the same thing. A lot of times you're handling request by doing another request, and then the database is really where the real work happens and hopefully don' the database you kind of scale that up and everything and then when you need to do business logic like we're doing with, but even our AI frankly is really like an eye out based thing like it's not doing very much work itself. It's calling an API and I'm really just doing the blocking approach for the sake of saying this over kind of keeping it really straightforward.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:22 ): thinking? Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:22 ): Yeah, just easier to write the code. but then when you get into store web workers as good as game development or when I was doing prosper there's some cases where it would have made sense. And generally speaking, the browser APIs now are even good about. you can have a general purpose web worker that runs in another process. you also gonna have specific ones for the drawing for audio for stuff like that better than managed by those subsystems.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:22 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:22 ): And if you do a generic worker, it generally is where you say That's CPU intensive, you're doing encryption or you're just doing something right. Yeah. I want the client to actually do a CPU intensive thing and then call that asynchronously. But then you have to use a message passing pattern, it really complicates the flow of data generally speaking. The problem, the polling is",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:22 ): it's already doing a lot of the heavy work in background threads and processes, but if you notice, we do the performance, it's not our thread that's being bogged down. It's the fact that we're asking the browser to modify, its internal state, very frequently. so the networking part of the browser is doing a lot of work after the fetch, It's not really like the user Frederick. I'm fetching once a second really? That's not a lot of CPU, kind of thing. So, generally doing the bigger thing, when you do is just have the browser do as work. By only really doing anything when they're changes, which means going to that full WebSocket approach,",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:22 ): No, I love something like this thing. sometimes my UID changes Suppose you are, and then you chat when there's an existing chat over and click the new chat, I don't know. the message does not get empty. That I need to double click sometimes.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:22 ): Yeah, I know. So too. I know it's up this morning and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:22 ): why it is happening?",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:22 ): I noticed with the history. Yeah, we're going to look into that bug.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:27 ): Because the function create new charges that has a job, four functions are there, first, remove the UID empty,\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:27 ): Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:27 ): the chat message, like that thing and do the project like that process is clearly stating that it should clear the inner HTML of the message area.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:27 ): Yeah, so we're gonna look at that code and see what's happening? yeah, I can't stop without us. Really looking at it, so it's\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:27 ): Yeah, and\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:27 ): I just about,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:27 ): that. and\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:27 ): we probably should go.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:27 ): the issue is one more thing that there is no other soul in the console, you will not understand. the function is throwing some error.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:27 ): Yeah, exactly. Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:27 ): It is facing some issue in clearing the message or something like that.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:27 ): Yeah, yeah. So okay. That's good to know. Yeah, so we'll get to that and look at that bug. So one thing is, maybe as we go forward we might want to actually start using the issue tracker and gitlab because now we're actually have this thing which is complex amount of those issues. So, that's a good example of just",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:27 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:27 ): We should just get into that habit of that, Leave partially by capturing that also. For now, we're just gonna scrambling which one get the MVP out as quickly as possible.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:27 ): Yeah. Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:27 ): Part of it is even if you fix a bug right away, even noting that in the issue Tracker allows in the future when you have that either class of bug or changes cause that progression has that record back. yeah. I know that's like an area that has potential problems and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:27 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:27 ): and so we'll try to just so I kind of have a list of things starting next week. We can kind of like and I'll take the weekends to think about What should we prioritize. And think through what we're doing, I'm still in the Middle East of all right Let's focus on the MVP at that bug. If we have time today we can just take a look at that one specifically. Don't worry about the issue tracker. We'll just kind of see we'll save that for a little bit. There's a few other things that are easier to fix.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:27 ): ",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:27 ): The verma and finding that, I added three functions here, in the background, I guess. It deleted it.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:27 ): Yeah. But anyway we'll talk about that.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:27 ): ",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:27 ): What state what's? yeah focus because today I would if we get as much done today as possible and then get it live,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:27 ): Yeah, the developer and\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:27 ): then we can take off the next three days.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:27 ): yeah. Yeah,\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:27 ): That's kind of my goal here.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:27 ): I want one. More thing is this thing. We are using. I guess HTTP one, I guess. Is it right in the engine next?",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:27 ): It's a little misleading. What? The version numbers refer to versus one 1.1 and 2? It's actually the sets of features that are in those and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:27 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:27 ): so we'll talk about that when we talk about Websockets, what the version means and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:27 ): Okay. \u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:27 ): the signaling version",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:27 ): because no, I was doing this Lighthouse report of seeing\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:27 ): Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:27 ): how the performance of the website is, so they're very commented.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:27 ): Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:27 ): This thing, like News HTTP, 2, Everything Institute.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:27 ): So what yeah, we'll go to The biggest thing with a lot of stuff like this is if your website works correctly and is performant, it's very easy to use those tools and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:27 ): Mmm.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:27 ): haven't give you very generic guidance. It's like do all the obvious things correctly, you're not doing the obviously, but if that's causing a problem, What is Web 2.0?",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:27 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:27 ): Web one point HTTP, 2.1 point, our backwards compatible So the idea that it's not high enough performance because you're not doing caching efficiently. Totally misses, the whole idea that we have a ridiculously simple website, that actually loads in under half a second.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:27 ): Right or should because there shouldn't be very many assets and if we're loading in more than that we really should actually figure out how to just reduce. You'll see all these react websites that then check all the boxes. And so White House, get a hundred percent and take 40 seconds to load and you're like, this isn't actually. Yeah, same thing with accessibility, there's all these straightforward accessibility rules but at the end of the day for website is usable and uses simple HTML. It's probably twice as good as something and I was like we don't violate any of the accessibility rules so we'll get. Okay so again let's for today,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:27 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:27 ): just focus on the issues you have and then next week we'll kind of decide where we want to prioritize our effort because the other problem is There's a lot of areas that we need to improve and once you put this version out live probably the next thing we actually need to do is just really focus on the actual. Dev and production separate so that we're at\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:27 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:27 ): then we're not messing up production as we go forward. And we really are gonna have to do that before we make any changes because it's gonna be how we make changes and then we'll kind of go from there and figure out, okay, what step comes after what step comes after that, but things that aren't causing problems.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:27 ): ",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:27 ): I would say for real users this is the whole idea of this lean startup of you put something out to users.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:27 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:32 ): If users aren't complaining about something, if it ain't broke, don't fix it type of thing. And it's good to use those tools and especially more from an SEO. Perspective is more where if we set that up with a webmaster tools later and then Google's like, we're downranking, your result, your page for this reason, you've got to fix that even if it's some silly thing that doesn't actually affect the, performance it'll hurt the results. even minor responsive design errors generally but even that later when we've gotten some feedback from people and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:32 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:32 ): I had one tester test it last night and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:32 ): Challenge.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:32 ): I already got a bunch of feedback so we can already start incorporating that some really obviously.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:32 ): Yeah. Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:32 ): And I did notice that one bug that you just mentioned this morning, but let's save that towards the end. Because if we can fix that, that's great, if we can it, it doesn't optical from using it, And it's almost one of those things that it's, so obviously a bug rather than a design flaw that, it'll just be something users are like, Okay, you got this bug fix this as opposed to back. you really need to do this? we know, of course, we do that, And the user generally aren't very rightfully. So creative when it comes to envisioning, what it could be but bugs, they're like, That's, fix that. So yeah. What? Just walk me through. What other changes did you make since yesterday that actually made it in there just so I can know what that is.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:32 ): So good.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:32 ): Okay, add the logo. Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:32 ): None of that logo is something else. That is the system assistant. I was playing there something here, I added that logo hiding thing. when there's a message,\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:32 ): Mm-hmm",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:32 ): don't show the low. when there is empty like me fresh new child,\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:32 ): Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:32 ): you need to show the logo, like there is no message.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:32 ): Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:32 ): No, so that they usually so show that you like that. So for logo, this is the logic. Which is that? And yeah, the lowest place here, actually, and the sidebar is always default open. So I keep it closed\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:32 ): Okay.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:32 ): because I saw in Mobile whenever you opens the side water as open itself. So, the UI gets \u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:32 ): Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:32 ): you do not see anything only the side, what",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:32 ): Yeah, yeah, exactly.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:32 ): So, I close that thing. And yeah, I did the logo thing here, Are and Chat section. Our company logo and everything. \u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:32 ): Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:32 ): And what?",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:32 ): Yeah, for message overflow, excited auto because it was overriding that part I saw that\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:32 ): Mmm.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:32 ): but still it did not fixed there, but somebody got fixed. I saw that, there is no fear that and\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:32 ): Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:32 ): I did and I guess Mobile brothers, said, I saw that because when you slide the browsers URL market side and because of that, sometimes the height calculation mismatch, I think I saw that that is some empty space shown in the widow.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:32 ): Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:32 ): So that's why I didn't really age dynamic.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:32 ): Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:32 ): High dynamic height, it is, I guess, but it does the dynamic height. According to the viewport that thing,\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:32 ): Wait. So that's supposed to wait a thousand. One. Oh lvh.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:32 ): Mm- No harm here. 100 LV HD.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:32 ): Okay, yeah I just can't see on the screen. Logical vertical.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:32 ): And see all the media.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:32 ): Okay I was gonna say you actually yeah,\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:32 ): at a media Good.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:32 ): \u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:32 ): all thing with respectful, civilization pixel, our cap.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:32 ): Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:32 ): That's not based. they know that it's mobile and average are and\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:32 ): Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:32 ): about that if you can see as a large screen. So I did this thing more like something place that I did this thing only like the Max would you really? I'm the CSS. And yes, yeah, this section on there, guys. I did not think that. Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:32 ): Very nice. Yeah. Good perfect. That's okay.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:32 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:32 ): So yeah, here's what I basically added. So one is I went and redid the main page. So goldsmithad.com and then I added a button link To the chat and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:32 ): Charity.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:32 ): just commented out For now. So it's kind of ready to go. Hes I'm commented and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:32 ): ",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:32 ): boom, the thing will work and then I also rewrote the terms of service and I did write up all privacy policy,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:32 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:37 ): cookie policy. So really after I thought I was just do it right up front because I already bought those documents a couple years ago for Prospero and so I just went into all three of those, updated them to have the right name date like email address. yeah. I knew there's something else I got to add contact at Goldsmith's Ai.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:37 ): Thank you.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:37 ): Okay I haven't already. As an alias, just because that's what I put on all the legal documents. Just not my email but I'm just, alias to mine. so all those are really, really simple. And right, the links I add an engine X. So, it's not like that HTML. It's just slash terms terms of service that should be really straightforward. And I added post post more Constripe are now in the terms of services,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:37 ): it's",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:37 ): these are the third party, gdpr data providers, so that's all set up.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:37 ): The European and all that thing, if it's like Europe and regulation or something like that is also there no. Come.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:37 ): Yeah, that's in the contract. The gdpr rules are in all three of those documents and then that's what those European Rules or gdpr is where you have to say what third party data providers. Using the end of the data provider is a third party,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:37 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:37 ): you pass personal identifiable information So i postmark obviously gets the email address of the user so they've got to be listed and then stripe obviously gets a lot of, payment information and then as we add other stuff like we'll try to generally keep up with that. I'm not too worried at that this point about. So the GDP has a very explicit system that it's like you get warnings. And if you're a small business rather than some bigger business, they're separate enforcement policies. And so even when I talk to a lawyer just to happen Run away on the train, who do you care? So I'm just gonna Pick this brain.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:37 ): What?",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:37 ): He's like if you're a startup just make sure to have the terms of service, be right? But really don't worry about it it's not like it's that",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:37 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:37 ): If you're not in the data like analytics startup kind of, that's what you do as a business. So we have a good enough now. It says what we use and for the cookies and everything, it's just sort of generic cookies policy saying We might use cookies for all these reasons. So if we use third-party analytics that'll be fine kind of whatever we do. the cookies thing does have this thing saying that cookies themselves will never contain personally identifiable information because that's like a regulatory requirement at this point. It's either from Europe, or California, or the United States, but that kind of means you should be careful. I know you're already doing it correctly, We have the off token but just be careful with the cookies that you don't put in the actual someone's like telephone number or address email address is obviously you want to be hard to put their telephone number in the cookies\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:37 ): yeah, that",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:37 ): so that's all should be good. And then let's see and then I updated that the back end that the generate HTML script to just now the prompt just has more aggressive language. So that one I wrote before I put in a few things that might have been it's make sure not to raw Israel. And then I just like, honest kid, make sure not to unescaped htmls, always escape HTML and then putting three and they even put in the purpose. the output of this will be directly assigned to inner HTML in an AI.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:37 ): Yeah, that idea, I did that thing. I was creating that query Actually,\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:37 ): Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:37 ): I said I was doing anything. I added three functions for that thing. I like to function 31st and something like this was at crop promote,\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:37 ): Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:37 ): But not at HTML anymore, style tax. The text contain any code section, Grab the specific section in court. do not add any ceases in former presentation original content and he shared our Buddhist properly formulated that thing. And for the renaming was, I was saying this thing generated title within 50 characters. Summarizing the talking, Do Not Cross. The limit of 50 character, including spaces, and it was fine.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:37 ): Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:37 ): I saw that the character it was either into 48, 45, including spaces.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:37 ): Mmm.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:37 ): I tried two things that thing.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:37 ): Yeah, we'll play around though. We'll hold those problems as we go to.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:37 ): Mmm.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:37 ): I want to before I get in it changing those too much though. I want to actually set up emails so that we know that it works as opposed to just and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:37 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:37 ): totally because otherwise he goes very biased towards the specific types of messages that we put it.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:37 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:42 ): And the other thing I rose with rename is, I think we need even more language being don't include the word request or question or quotes, a few of them that come back has, the word requests shows up in song that I did where it was essay request and that's not really what the user wants as the time they won't. Not request about essay for Washington DC. there's essay about Washington DC or something what will hone that and we'll hone in the next few weeks. that's where I want to really figure out how we want, this to work, and we'll hone all that. But for today, I'm not gonna make the additional changes\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:42 ): Yeah. Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:42 ): unless I kind of want to test a little bit to see if Just get it so it doesn't screw up the CSS, if we",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:42 ): Yeah, that I didn't write that. I tried testing all the things. So this is why I am meditation for the media.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:42 ): Yeah. you got the site the Okay.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:42 ): Yeah. Yeah it is that it's updated.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:42 ): Yeah, I'll log in",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:42 ): In Moana. So I was checking that thing and then I got to know what the height and the side watching.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:42 ): So, the chat is I see closed by default on desktop,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:42 ): Yeah. Yeah,\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:42 ): as right?",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:42 ): I kept that.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:42 ): Yeah, I mean, I think we want to open on desktop as the common case is gonna be people, frankly using this on desktop, at least in the short term.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:42 ): Okay.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:42 ): And so, yeah, I think we",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:42 ): I added my default, I guess for that. Decide what the worst thing?",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:42 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:42 ): Because My big thing is I want to make sure that technically it works. Responsibly in the sense that it works and it won't cause an SEO problem, but I do kind of want to for emphasize the desktop version for the time being because we're gonna have very large, Format answers.

  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:42 ): just don't have sidebar cause note that this is something that you want to add because I got some thoughts on this too, that might make more sense. Actually, in close the sidebar, when someone creates a new chat or clicks on a chat automatically or",

  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:42 ): Yeah, so we'll figure that out there for now.

They suggest. so we'll talk through some of those changes. I do want to make and those other than that,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:42 ): Yeah.",

  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:52 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:52 ): And then slash terms /. Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:52 ): All these are like this on your",

  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:52 ): and link is proper terms of service.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:52 ): Those are Looks right. Only just go back to we'll check but yeah. Terms of service privacy laws. Yeah.",

  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:52 ): yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:52 ): I didn't even just straight CSS. Just like it's the legal document.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:52 ): But it should be good cover, Reasonable amount of liability protection and students.",

  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:52 ): Yeah. Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:52 ): Yeah, so it's good. Yeah, and then the same thing like you already doing. I said, back in the actual chat",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:52 ): Yeah and then just Yeah, good. I just had a three separate links.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:52 ): All the terror.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:52 ): Yeah. And that way, that",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:52 ): Whatever that is.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:52 ): They probably should be separate list items. Meaning it's actually just. yeah. Okay.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:52 ): yeah, like that. Not that was there. I guess I",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:52 ): I,",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:52 ): we are three or\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:52 ): Yeah that was good cookies.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:52 ): not, they are",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:52 ): Yeah privacy. Yeah, that should be good. And then",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:52 ): We knew this right now, too. I realize too. so for that button right now, that's like a question mark, right kind of similar to chat GPUs other ones. this could be other information. Let's actually rename that. So it just actually says terms I was like a text link with no circle around it because four from just a legal for now I want people to be really, really obvious you can find our terms when you're in the chat without because you don't have anything else in there.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:52 ): That makes sense.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:52 ): Yeah, so instead of a question mark, I know Chat Gbt has it but the thing is tragedy also has a lot of big website explaining everything and documentation pages and blog posts and all these things for us, I just want to be more like Nope this is the terms of service. So that what? it's really obvious to people.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:52 ): If the only thing they're doing is sitting on chat,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:52 ): Then.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:52 ): they know where to find the terms. So you have a question mark right now, just replace the question mark with the word terms.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:52 ): And so,",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:52 ): ",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:57 ): just so that we'll be able to only have A lawyer make it, I do my rules like air on the side of being a conservative when you can't actually figure out if I don't use that Eric Schmitz kind of thing like big companies can afford to break all the rules. They just tire lawyers and take care of it.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:57 ): Google.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:57 ): It's that's and then So then you can push your intent but also in the CSS there's a circle around the question. Mark, which looks good for the question mark, but now with the word terms, I found that it's probably better not to have the circle around it because it \u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:57 ): Hey.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:57 ): it's not a squarish thing. You can try like this either way you want to do it but",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:57 ): Expect high as you.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:57 ): yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:57 ): Now.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:57 ): Is it?",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:57 ): Yeah. Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:57 ): That's what I talk.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:57 ): so, we got rid of it in a single,",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:57 ): Its problem. Don't bother. Okay.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:57 ): Yeah. Yeah. And then each other thing is like, this winter or this town some condition or not.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:57 ): That's good for the turn. Yeah, it's push those. Let's see if that should be it for the terms and conditions. sign up, chat through",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:57 ): The cloud is in enterprise plan or in something else like What's the plan of our cloudy.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:57 ): Integrate that at some point? I mean again,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:57 ): Integration was not the plan we are running or\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:57 ): on Monday.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:57 ): pricing was. what's the plan of purchase for the cloudy actually?",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:57 ): I got the team plan. So that way,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:57 ): No, I said no,\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:57 ): it has all the front.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:57 ): I guess. Yeah, and",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:57 ): Yeah, the team plan is a minimum got",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:57 ): Then I was in any day yesterday Cloudy, came up with some feature with a guitar sinking and\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 14:57 ): Mm-hmm",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 14:57 ): they are increased, the context lint, I guess. And to find it. I guess in that particular segment yesterday. Having the media after half an hour,\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:02 ): Okay,",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:02 ): I guess, or before half an hour, they launch that. We generates that thing, particularly",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:02 ): Yeah. Was it probably should be the plan.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:02 ): that's,",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:02 ): I wasn't the enterprise plan now. Okay. I see.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:02 ): Yeah, and\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:02 ): Yeah right.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:02 ): it's enterprise accurate.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:02 ): Yeah so enterprise I'm not sure they don't list their pricing for enterprise. I assume the biggest thing is, you need a minimum head count of at least 50 or maybe a hundred, something like that. And so even the fact that their team plan is a minimum five is very unusual. I think they recognize that this is the way the demand is and people are willing to pay for three hundred fifty dollars.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:02 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:02 ): If they actually use these features for me it was more like we need to just be keeping up with the latest reasonable price point of the latest features are because they added projects and artifacts a lot of these features and the team plan. Plus, it's just the way they manage payment otherwise we have to manage payments separately,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:02 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:02 ): you can't have an individual account. So with the Open aI, It's not that expensive. twenty five dollars per user, you kind of a team with just two users so that's pretty cheap Google. It's like you can have the Gemini plan for $20 a month per user in addition to 20 dollars per the base price.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:02 ): Right.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:02 ): So it's 80 bucks for the two of us, whereas caught. So we could add a couple other people who are, three more people, wouldn't cost me more. But for now it's good. Just as we can Just yeah,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:02 ): Yeah. Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:02 ): we Won't have access. Okay, it turns this way, that was good.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:02 ): Yeah, that's nice. And then terms of service, Yeah, that's right. Just really obvious to people like yep. There are",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:02 ): When looking and\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:02 ): Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:02 ): it could do here, yes.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:02 ): Yeah, you do that. I'm gonna test the login again. Just",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:02 ): That target language.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:02 ): yeah, underscore blank. Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:02 ): Yeah. Push it.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:02 ): Alright, and I'm using one of the aliases to",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:02 ): why didn't I create the content other? It's contact a goldsmiththeticom, To create a new account to test the terms of service there. I realize it's probably not the email deliver. It's probably just taking a minute to generate the new alias. Let me do contact it or effects.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:02 ): yeah that was the other thing I realized so we don't have to change this now but just as a thought on the login or sign up page, the feedback of \u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:02 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:07 ): keep it, I'm saying, you've been sent a magic link but keeping the email there. And then if I do it again, for example, I just did that right, Santa, Steve that goldsmithai.com and then realize, no, I wanted to send it at, contactslabs.com when you send a second email, nothing changes and so there's no feedback to the user That actually Submitted in a second time, Because it always already says, you received the magic link. And then you have the ability to send another magic link when you do it though. Doesn't update. just still says, You should have a magic. we don't need to change that now. But just a thought for the future of how do we want that to actually",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:07 ): Meaning first time, the user enters the presence and that time every process happened. No, the sunny and second, let me again enters, it does not send that you're telling all like the you get",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:07 ): No, no first I'll tell me the function, I doesn't send it as second time. Is that how the \u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:07 ): Argument.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:07 ): I got the email. Yeah, it sends it a second time but the problem is So the first time there's no message, right? So you hit send and then you get a message saying,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:07 ): ",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:07 ): you should have received a magic link, just go check it. We do it. The second time that message is already there. So when you click it,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:07 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:07 ): it doesn't like nothing changes, So there's no signaling to the user. It's a more subtle problem, I mean,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:07 ): All right.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:07 ): that we just have to figure out later but just doesn't know, we'll think about that. I just ran into that for the first time, but I got the email, the good part is like I cook the button and then, I got the email. All right, so I'll create a new account, all right. So,",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:07 ): Good night and that we are send me whether this and this link or something like that, that would be an indication.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:07 ): We'll figure it out later. I mean, I just want to note it I was actually as a user Okay, we have that's a thing we should figure out, we don't want to don't change it now like it works now.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:07 ): Words this, yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:07 ): And what",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:07 ): Yeah. Yeah. That's one word only. so,",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:07 ): This will indicate that it sent that email.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:07 ): Yeah, yeah, That's good. Okay. yeah. And then when I load the page, this is the thing with we don't need to figure this out now I guess. But later we'll do more styling, right? Yeah,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:07 ): Yeah, that thing.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:07 ): But the dark theme is I'm torn on it's not bad but one is though the intermediate tones, the grays are actually tough to get contrast to work well and then maybe in the future we'll figure out. Do we really want A dark theme. But for now, what I notice is we need to do that with very least the login page because it's that dark gray. The links aren't readable on the login page.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:07 ): I can share my screen and show you but for another purpose with the purple definitely isn't readable, but I'll just share.",

  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:07 ): No, no. It should be white on there today.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:07 ): yeah, if we're gonna have a black background, make everything white It really doesn't matter\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:07 ): And they attacked. No.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:07 ): if they change it. I just set both of visited and the nav visited to white. I mean, there's really no.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:07 ): reason why it needs to show that it's visited. for this type of,",

  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Which is Okay, So that looks good and I like that it's actually next to the thing that says terms also. So it's like all this legal fine print is significant and So those are really the only ones that I was like, Okay I definitely want to add that before we put it live so that we have sort of that protection. Okay? Yeah. All the other ones are sort of either minor a little bit of feedback I got through either kind of bug fixes or a little bit of styling stuff. I don't want to go too far down the styling rabbit hole. Because what I want to do is when next week we kind of say what are priorities and probably won't be the number one priority but kind of put on that list, at some point do a full styling and actually, decide what a strategy is gonna be for deciding how we actually do design, going for now, this is great,\u2026",

  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): and that just Meaning it doesn't turn into the pointer like a wink.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Since.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah, no. But It should be a Go to another button and hover over a button. Pointer Pointer.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): yeah, okay.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah, it's a minor thing. it really wouldn't matter but I don't know. Just one line change. I figure. We'll just do it just because it's so easy.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): It's one of the things that they weren't like I'm testing, they probably wouldn't have even noticed. But that's the easiest one. So everybody to start with that, just to be all right. That kind of, Because that's the other part too, whatever. When we get feedback from a user, I want you to really difficult, it's best to fix it. So that then later they're not fixing the problems. So I'm not gonna give them feedback,",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): You'd be amazed. I don't know. It's just like, you fix that thing that I told you about, my gosh. that's incredible. listen. Okay. But yeah,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah, this thing then.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): So that was really the only one that was Pretty trivial.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): The other ones, let me start with when we just go through.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Okay so the one was the most this might not be easy to fix. Let's talk about it. That was the most glaring is actually the fact that there's no Auto Scroll to the next output message. it wasn't working. I'm not sure whether it's supposed to be, meaning if you're up here, if you type in a new message and hit submit It doesn't scroll down to the result, right?",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): I got this. Yeah that I just send it and\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): excited in the chat message.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah, so they didn't realize. Was it one day you went to the second message, They weren't noticing, Hey, the scroll bar gets bigger or something, so they didn't realize the message had come in. So there's the scroll to element, right? And then that'll put that element at the top. So probably the easiest way is just, do the scroll to when a new system message comes in. It's tricky though. Because with the pulling and everything, we can't keep scrolling to otherwise a really screw up the user interface, it has to happen exactly at what I mean? only when a new message comes in. So if it's tricky, maybe we won't even add it right now. But that's a big usability like thing.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): No Not today because we don't know what's the new message That.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah, yeah. So let's hold off on doing now. And that's where I kind of assume that it would actually be trickier than it seems. But that'll be like a priority because I do think that it's just in the happy path. That's like, anytime you're doing a chat. On the other hand and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): No.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): most users it's not gonna actually prevent them from using it Because they're gonna be okay. it didn't I'll scroll down and see it. They're not gonna Wait, forever. And at some point, they're not as a scroll bar at some point, they'll find it. But",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): so we won't do that today but yeah, that'll be a good one to the list, okay. Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Good one red districts, presentation, comparing the new messages appears, whether without that I guess. So, we can directly state our score to the bottom.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): If there is a change in the door,",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Let's give it a try really worth it.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): ",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): yeah, if it is, then what you doing? Scroll to what?",
  "01 (2024-09-05 15:12 ): 25:00",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): There's a stroll to if you take an element Dot scroll to I believe is what it is. Scroll top,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Will talk.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): scroll top. Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Something like this,\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): it should be a photo,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): ?",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): there should be, it's not an ad I thought Only, let's look it up and",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): yeah, it's Scroll to method of an element. It's a function. So yeah, it's a method so just be like element Dot scroll to and then y, coordinate. I want to display.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): I don't know, inside the go down. This is the wrong one. Okay, no, never mind. it's",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): It grow light. I know that it's easy. But it is okay for all that, they",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah, you say like that that you can do but there's a Better more straightforward method. That's",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): That works more consistently methods visible in the browser? Yeah, yeah, scroll into view with. No, there's an option argument, don't have to go, so the default is it will scroll the top of the element. So element that scroll into view,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): What?",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): that's the most reliable.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah, listening right.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Scroll into view. And then that should be.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Think of a message area. Presentation.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah. And what?",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Meaning the new message only the new messages.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): You want the new message, you want the system message? Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): So, whichever is the new message, according to the dog that will straight away, scroll into that.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Okay, let's see how that works. Yeah, that should be good.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Okay, let's put it.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Check it.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): You, but",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Or maybe doing in the existing whether it's a but interesting with the code area, see how it is. Think.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah, so shouldn't it be the Okay,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): That is fine, actually.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): so is it because",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): The school up a little bit as we'll see what's above that is their text in the",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): It's the last message they are, scroll it in the center, actually, I guess.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah, the default should be top. There's no wine attribute that you can pass in. We want to be top, we do want that the logo and the title showing up in the thing when otherwise they won't know that that's up there and that's kind of the",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Okay, I got it.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): So there's two reasons why it's usually happens either it's scrolling into view but then that header is causing the problem. It's actually like the top is align with the very top of the page or",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): this behavior something,\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): I\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): which would add I'll keep it,\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): and I wouldn't",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): default something.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Start with default. Let's see how that works. I didn't. Yeah, I thought what I'm looking at the",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): do it just",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah, top left.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): That's scroll to the scroll, and yeah, I mean I don't think",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): so over to talk real,\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): so interviewed.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): and to talk it should Yeah, I learned to talk.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah, which should be the DC.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): but, Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): The default is Yeah, so that I don't think is really causing the problem. The question is why the top isn't lining up with the top that's visible.",
  "01 (2024-09-05 15:12 ): 30:00",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Things.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Let me see if I get",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): So I guess this is just another part. I'm seeing how this Stuff is hiding behind the spinner as well.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): ",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): And the",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): I know it is information.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): ",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah, right.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): They Where did you?",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): You take any other side?",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): That just Remove that. It added. The Beavis mode. No. That was some issue.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah, wouldn't you change that?",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Okay.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): I guess. The default is it is aligning to the top.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah. okay, so here",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Check my second ones. You try and enter, refresh it and send some residency.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): And shares with all.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): I'm running a hold on. I did a second request so goldsmith that I was thinking Good. There you go. Okay.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Okay.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah. No. So It seems to work fine. Yeah, it shows the logo, on the top. the logo for being the chat.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): What I'm noticing though? So that works great. In terms of when you have a long message, it's correctly showing up at the top of that, the final message but what I notice is when I put in a new chat, that's only one line, it's being hidden behind the spinner. Object. And so you can't see because of how It's not even really the scrolling just generally speaking. what happens when you put in A new message\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): if you can reproduce that? or see if it's just a",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Or sorry, just a new message in a long chat",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): that's like a one line.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): I'm not sure what I'm looking at.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Try one that doesn't have all the CSS screwed up this one's actually a bad. Test because,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah, this isn't this on this one?",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): hopefully in the future. We do have that. Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): So try to do a new chat, right? Yeah, okay. Rather a new message in this chat. Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): That's fine, doesn't really matter what it is.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Obviously.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): you just run it. I mean,",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): See how the?",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): ",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah, so I think you just need to make that main view. Not it should never actually overlap with the thinking or I yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): I'm glad I got that thing.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Digital Hits you.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): It's just",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Music about it.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Actually like this. But it will not.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah, CC testing also the side. One does not get updated to refresh it.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): You mean that when you keep working on one of you before?",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah. That's immature.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): That you notice our",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah, that'll be fine. I mean that's not",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): We want to fix that in the future, add that to the West. But the problem is I know someone like because this did come up who had nothing to do with the scrolling. It was just like someone typed in, Wait a second. Where's my message? it's thinking but again it, see their own message. So that's like a Affects usability.",
  "01 (2024-09-05 15:12 ): 35:00",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah. Because then they have to know it's like,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): That's actually.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): I've got to scroll down,\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): right? It's not.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): You need.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): But it was happening before you added scroll into view to be clear, this is something that happened yesterday, with long chats, it was burying the end. It was burying the other chat. On the bottom. because it wasn't scrolling so it's just never should be able to have any content that's like",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Let me see if response come no and how it shows the response. it shows here, then",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): we'll get the CSS. For example, when you inspect the elements see how it's actually like it overlaps, the thinking, rather than just being cleanly.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah, one out of that. Yeah, that one. See how the chat messages? Is actually this really, really large dev, right? It's extending to the top and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Okay.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): the bottom rather than just being in that. I think you're just a height 100%. To the one outside. It is then actually controlling.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): And then try putting another chat and seeing how When it's thinking, if it doesn't overlap.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Are you making that thinking? Is that just like an overlay on top?",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): No, no no,\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): How is it?",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): it is not our life. It wouldn't overlay about this thing and",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): It's the order I know what's happening. It's doing scroll into view before. It's actually then adding the thinking and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): so then it's not scroll down.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): What is in? it is doing first, there is scrolling and then it is adding so that Yeah,\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): I think so. Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): that's So it stays in the top of that message and\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Mm- Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): That thing happened. Yeah, I got that.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): That might be an easy fix Just changing the order. Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): the logic is order of message. Loading is here and",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): And then spinner visibility.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): So another reason it is after the whole group and otherwise it continuously play with that thing.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Domination happens. That's why kept it out that thing.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Do you still have a question? So if it is a user message in that you could just duplicate that leave it there,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): I got a.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): and then put it also in the bottom. So that works for the system message and then",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): No like this,\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): you need to get that thing, the message and message type is what and then if it is the center that because it will add the thinking, then you align it to the bottom, something like that or a line talk is false.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): I don't know. You have to worry about that. I mean, we can try to do that but I think frankly just calling scrolling to view again in the spinner logic. For now see if that works, just also copy and paste the scroll into view back, that double scrolls back to back isn't gonna cause a big problem and then after down below where you have update spinner in the one where you're displaying the spinner. I don't think that's far enough down because Update spinners below that",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): yeah, this thing naturally.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): In the remove hidden. So, after 8:59.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): It should work tonight.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): then that's a job and then it should just scroll and at least that should",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Albert methane element is out side.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah. That's\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): I guess that's",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): what I was wondering. Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): But it's still in scope if and else, don't create new scope only functions, great news, go. it's inside of four each okay? Yeah.",
  "01 (2024-09-05 15:12 ): 40:00",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): The other one is we can push it to scroll all the way to the bottom because after someone puts in a message, it's reasonable not even to show the bottom of their message. scroll all the way down to the bottom of that. Anyway, whatever you get to work on.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): you can say this channel, that",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): I don't think the very least, you have to array.from the Dom list, and that'll turn into a rat. And then you can look it up.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): I didn't mean. and then applying assuming, that all the messages, displayed on the last message,\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): we need to pick up and scrolling into that.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah. Have you tried this though? I thought Query selector all returns a domalist. Right? If you do a radar from.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah, that's right.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): So do this At the beginning of the line. Do a ray capital array dot from.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah, yeah. That function",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): That converts it into an array. Yeah. And then you can",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah. that should work.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Is actually. Yeah, it's not list of element.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): It's a list which is an array thing but I always forget which it doesn't have all the array operations. It has some of them I always do a radar from because then you can do that length and dot all sorts of",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): For each and everything. I'm pretty sure it doesn't have for each. That's the big one. but,",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): yeah, it was",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): great. Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): yeah. This also fit. Story about this world storage.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah, right.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Still thinking. Yeah, generating large content just takes long time. I try to find a quick one. I was just generate five paragraphs of gibberish or five Fergus. it's just still takes time like it doesn't",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): just not really surprising given how it works but",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): ",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah, yeah, it looks something but",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): I just got a weird current, only try another thing. We're court case. There's actually now showing the chat message tag.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): that's,",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah. Meaning the internal kind of logic of the multi-stage prompt I'm doing. There's just start chat message and chat message tag and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): okay.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): I can't. I mean it almost never happens so far. this is the second time that it's shown up in the output.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): But I mean that's not as long as it doesn't happen. Very often we'll just figure that out later getting more deterministic. but I was curious if you'd ever",
  "01 (2024-09-05 15:12 ): 45:00",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): there we go. All right. They're just another prompt. It didn't do that. and then if I go into another message,",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): At shoot, did I not?",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Ocean.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Okay, there we go. Yeah, I just had forgotten to refresh Okay, so that works great nice. that's a big one. that'll just",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): One. he's taking this like this.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): It corporate like this. Check that it's perfect.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): it's doing markdown.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah, it's converting into Markdown. Yeah, which I guess it's perfect.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Wait. where'd you copy that from? Yes, you're probably copying message content rather than message HTML rho,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): It sent by that. Here click the copy, right?",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): the message content while output no.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): ",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): But I actually think that we got to decide if that's not the right idea. I mean a lot of cases That's the thing with copy.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): No, it's",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): What is it Do they want to copy the whole thing? They really want to copy the generate HTML, Probably not, right? I mean,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Mmm.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Let's take a step, what? Let's talk about that in a second because that's one of the things on my list.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): It's those buttons. But no actually, there's the right way, it should work which is it copies, message content, and",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): But anyways, okay, so you're right, you tested the scrolling works. That's great. That's a big fix. The other ones, I don't have a good fix for this and that you did it. The way that I kind of wanted it and I knew this was gonna be an issue for users. But do you like the fact that we have a multi-line for the input message users? They're doing a single query to hit enter and they expect it to submit right and both GPT in Claude have different strategies for this, right? Would you be?",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): No, no.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): It's like when you enter that thing submits and it makes it very frustrating. when you're actually trying to do really complex prompts, but it is really, really convenient when you are just chatting with it and you're putting in",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): it's like one line you hit enter. again, I kind of had told you explicit we want to emphasize more complex problems. I want people to be able to put in code and full thing. So I'm not necessarily convinced that we want to change it at this point. but there might be some easy, I kind of thinking through some one is I notice with clawed like it provides better feed. I forget exactly what it says but it has some language that explains how it works, it's like I actually open up you have clot open. There you go in but open up Quad and I just want to see how it works in Claude.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah, so when you do a reply In the actual chat box. Yeah. not the copy. We'll come back to that later. I'm not worried about the copying with everybody. I'm talking about just in the reply to Quad message box. does that make sense the ideas right now, if you type in a short",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): ",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): question and then hit enter. Does it just directly submit?",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): They are just.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): So Claude even changed this when they first released it they had some language that was like if you want to. So if you want to do a multi-line, if you want to edit if you want to do a multi,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): People out here.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): right, you",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): People give that there go a shortcut. what that thing toward you control shift and does something like that.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Control s*. Yeah. And they used to have a message telling you\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): For next line and",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): what it was. Yeah. I was like, I thought I'd control something in it. But yeah. Have you ever had to do this with quad? How do you do multi wine?",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Why I think they have did I guess that's the default feature. Yeah we're in. I guess what? Suppose something like that, social media platform Vegas. they tend to like that's the So,\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): you can say standard, when you want multi-lining inputs like thing,\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): you will confuse your plantar and then are your days.",
  "01 (2024-09-05 15:12 ): 50:00",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Here's show do it right now. It's gonna make sure that's The right set of commands. Do a multi-line input. Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): yeah, Shift,\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): And stuff.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): enter Work shift and\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Control, yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): No, no shift and it is showing also this thing you shift + return.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah, Yeah. Okay.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Third thing.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): And then it shows that pop up like you shift enter for new wine\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): but What was I did Did it only add that after you did it the first time? They used to have that all the time,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Okay, that",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): but I thought then it's like Okay. \u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah. No.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): once you start typing it pops up.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): No. You did not show default. Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah. So yeah, I mean,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): but,",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): I don't necessarily want to, I don't know what's not change it? I don't know and maybe get feedback from people, but I do think there's gonna be an issue because, right now, someone just keeps hitting enter enter and just adds new lines to the multitude thing.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Mmm.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): And then it's not like it's just awkward middle ground. We're adding just enough space, I mean for four or five lines that it's ambiguous. Whereas, as soon as someone hit enter, if it popped up to a half page editor, it would be way more obvious or something I'm editing a full document and then maybe I have to tab to go to the other thing.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah, I mean I'm almost tempted to for right now. Just making it so that when they hit enter it just submits because that is the default that people expect right when they've used all these other pools and then we can get feedback from them if they're like, it's really frustrating. How do I add multiple lines or something mental?",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): And problem is this thing was like and\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): I'm torn because Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): that will work for the shift written thing. It is different for different machine, like real life,\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah exactly.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): something else",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): That's why it's pretty complex actually add. So yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): As it don't, screw it out now and you can go that we are feature of enter and summit, but then all that enter will work on them. I have multiline people,",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah. What. Yeah. I think this capability. Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): No no. Keep it like that or later with that this was better. Actually I just return. I think entering some advice",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): so when you say on ours, when you go to submit you use Tab or do you actually use the mouse, like what I use the mouse.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Mouse. yeah,",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Okay, I use Tab, I tap over it because of my hands, don't leave the keyboard but that's The other part which is like because there's no audio in mind, it's a single tab. So it's like tab enter,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Hi guys. That",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): and That's pretty quick but it's not. Yeah. What does leave? It is just something I think to get feedback from users and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): ",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): then kind of see as we go because I noticed this was probably the biggest thing that actually was like a user interface, kind of thing. and later maybe we can figure out some subtle way to emphasize the button or something, maybe it has an animation on the background. If you hit enter three times in a row, it highlight and we don't want to do that right now. But if we get feedback.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): No, I'm seeing that thing. Is that how it all?",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah, but like you said it's trickier to implement that it seems like cross-platform",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): And that's one thing. perform back windows, both.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Because I'm like the command and control shift there's just shift key on every, keyboard and it's always the same button. which probably why it's the choice and rather than control or Alt or something which has command and",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): And if you checked it yeah the Shift key is part of the event.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah, this thing is that.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah so it's not super complicated.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): what the Mac has this thing called, the shifting",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): yeah, every keyboard has shift is just capitalized temporary",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): The one why we are so we add this English straight away. This is the thing which will work then I like shift keys there and those are that.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): And what I'm like are in the system, so it will work another and we shared that",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah, but So then let's take a step back and talk. That's true. If someone does want to add a multi-line Sorry are we gonna add the same message like clause? The right. We're gonna actually put tax being Use Shift + Center.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yes, I yeah.",
  "01 (2024-09-05 15:12 ): 55:00",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah, I mean, I kind of like the way but",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): If it is giving them why we are where We can add here for nothing.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Right here. We should. Not take much time is.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Okay, thanks there yet. So it's actually That, and",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): So yeah, it's a little too. You have to actually have an event handler for the text area, right? And\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): yeah, that's complex something",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): that event is gonna call the buttons Click event.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): So that texture that input should probably be the one that you check the key code on. You already have a handler for it,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): my yeah,\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): attached to it. Okay.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): that is when I ended up and are like, what to say, adjusting the height actually",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah, but you have a handler. I just thought I saw a handler for input.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah, In Protea.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): The input. Yeah. So instead of having directly call adjust height, have input have an inlet have a call back function, there that I just height, and then puts in the code that you just found and then have that call the Submit button that click.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): And then you need the event to be in the callback for that.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): if just,\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): There's a few changes you have to make, okay?",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Call Yeah, that is one more that charging putting. Okay? That's what's up, right? Okay.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): okay, so I mean, yeah, I sure are saying, the other way is actually just call the click handler of the button, right? Because that will mean that Anyway.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): That is what summit, this is for the new next line.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): I know what I'm saying, is for the equals third.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): ",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): It's fine. If we're under an issue, we'll change it later.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): I'll come over to the next area.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): So what? Okay. So yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): when I'm checking audited for that, the value can",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Okay, then whatever.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): so one is, you want to be adding new ones when you are holding down shift, Not when you're not holding down shift.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Hey, I'll do this first though.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Of both your learning**. I know shift.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Put them both, and then have that one. Be not inverted and then the other one, be the inverted. One another one of above me and not.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): very good. This should be there, actually like this.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah, like that. And do that one of above. So it's exactly the opposite. So that it's",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): yeah, I'm going.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): otherwise that will only hit first,",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah I don't happen every time. Yeah yeah and then also just as a you need to be the argument to that call back function, right? That's where the event comes from. It's just all.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): It. Yeah, yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah. Yeah.",
  "02 (2024-09-05 15:12 ): 00:00",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): And I am adding row should not be there, something I should be that it should presentation.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): You actually should add a slash and a pen,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): It will work or",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): a new line character to the actual content. See the value. Yeah, there you go. Yeah, that should work. yeah, and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): And that.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): then here's, I would say with the handle send messages, just this should work because you're directly doing the thing that the button does. But if somebody added, if later, you decide to add a callback for example on, click of the button, does some user interface thing.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Okay.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): The way you can kind of consistently have all the mechanisms, go through those callbacks is you actually call the click handler of the button. Right. They're not duplicating the logic. Right? So instead of manual thing, we're gonna send the message like, you call, right? That makes sense like The.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): click the button,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): says, That only.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Push the button.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah, exactly.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): And that way, you see what if you had an event handler attached to the button I did like CSS for animating it that would happen in that case and these are back. yeah. I submitted it, Yeah. Yeah,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): I find that just Yeah, this was good. Not shift gear with the button if we are. Sure cute. Yeah, I don't need just This is pretty sure for",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Should I find?",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): But shift your first return should add a new line.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): I don't know.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): What behind?",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yes. What do you know?",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): But",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): I'm saying it for new wine. Yeah, that's good.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): yeah. Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah, that's good.",

  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): I mean, she notice that you're still putting inside a P tag. I think it's probably in a span. The P is actually trying to a block element.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): I was thinking to add inside this input box and\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): No I think it should be.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): below are",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): It is in the tree but then because you have a P tag even though it's inside that one,",

  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): I just make those piece spans and I think it should You have to manually position, I wasn't sure. how are you expecting to be in the bottom, right? I would think.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): it didn't cause social then",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): You might need a class attached to that one and then actually add CSS and no, thank you.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah, that thing also but this rapper is Attic groups. Okay. no. Yeah, it's true.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah. it seemed like it was inside the thing that but it, yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): I'm not localization.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): We're at a class to it. Yes and that way it'll be easier even before you push it at a class so that way you can. Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yes.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): It's okay.",

  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): If I send the",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Aren't you just do that? Actually have it and I don't think it's actually bad to have an outside the text box itself but to the right and then have it.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Like that, I actually like that. I actually got good because in the text box is like",

  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): I don't do too much more tweaking out because one of the things I do want to talk about is fonts and then that'll change how other stuff works. First off like that. That's two different fonts in the same.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah, same paragraph.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Just keep it like that's the part. I don't really want this to look exactly like chat gpt. We're a little too.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): No, no color that I",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): It is big. we'll talk about that a minute. just make it Black was good.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah. Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Just pick something, put it in there, that's fine. We'll",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah, That's great. Okay. let's test it actually make sure that the enter and shift works. It doesn't seem",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah, shift and shift enter works over Sandmanship.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): And that is not taking.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah, that part didn't work for me. Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Excellent solution was long.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): I think. Shaved render works. No only and everything did not",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah.",
  "02 (2024-09-05 15:12 ): 15:00",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah, I mean, the thing too, is I don't think we have the right event in the sense that the input event. Isn't the same as the key down or key up events. Right? Or keep press, all those key events, it's the whole box. So I think you actually rather than input, maybe the wrong one, it probably should be key down when they're in that box and have the key down, the enter key, as opposed to the resize. the height should be on input the promise and have the individual key data. It has the data for the whole value.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): And there's key press, but that doesn't differentiate between up in a key down. Yeah, I think you want. hit Enter not when they release it submits. Yeah, so just key down something. We just want to add another event handler.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): You don't know, yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah. Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): I'm sorry, it's another So that texture that add event listener, key down and that'll be in parallel, the input will only do the adjust height and then both those, if statements will happen in the key down.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Shift keys.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): There's key rather than key code is the more modern one and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): .",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): then there's code and there's key, I would recommend using key.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): and then,",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): We are key. The Language.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Whatever it is for enterprise, I think it should actually be a string. Which let's see. She's gotta find.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Birds and that for you but key how should I find what our keys are? it got recorded.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): What do you mean? Yeah, event a key. Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): What is it?",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah, it should be and this is one key.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah. Exactly.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): the Shift key.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Other just get rid of it from input, so that input only does adjust height. But that looks good.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): That event handle looks good. But then see how above you still have the Yeah.",
  "02 (2024-09-05 15:12 ): 20:00",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah, that was good.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): The other one Yeah, we'll see this works. I was gonna say, we just might not need to add that new line, because that already is the default. We'll see. I don't think adding an event handler to key down, actually changes How the user effects. Yeah, but we'll see.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Been pretty obvious. If we get to new ones,",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yes, your friend.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah. Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): I take that. I think this thing.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Nice.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): yeah, like What?",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): It's by default action.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah, and when I do shift, enter now, it's acting two at a time. Nice and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): ",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): if I hit enter and it works. So I think you just get rid of the",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): it's",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Nice.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): it's got fixed Next. We are.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah, that's awesome. This is much better. Completely test it.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah, we're good.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah, you can just",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): ",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): they should know. Yeah, you can test it.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah, We'll figure it out today's minor bugs, but I know it's like, sometimes when I do new and there's the one you were talking about, but I just ran into again. sometimes I do new chat and I click it once. This last time was weird. It actually seemed to get rid of all the previous ones chat content except for the thinking it was still like those that I was thinking and then when I did new chat again it really cleanly went back to the like No I don't know. We'll figure that out later but there's definitely some weirdness.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): You are the chat licking know that I know.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): All right, testing. Just another. Yeah, there's one line that's good. Yeah, that works. Great.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Okay, so then yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): A couple things more. All right, yeah, let's talk about this one. This might not change anything but",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): so the buttons underneath the system that are like when you hover over the system message, Right for the copy. Let's talk about those because we didn't really ever go over kind of what we wanted for the launch. one thing I noticed. So first of all, just from a UI standpoint. This is what actually the user comments on was like if it's not the only message, If you have another chat that you put in and you're going back to the first message, for example, it actually could kind of weird thing because when you hover over it, pushes the message below back and forth out of the way, you know what I mean?",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): To our good,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): ",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): go to one one, they have multiple chats of multiple messages. Go down the right there. Yeah. See how it's like, it just has this. it's either. I kind of feel like either should always be there at the base of the chat. I mean, but I think in the long term we need to figure out Do we have a better way to delimit the system message with actually a box around it to be like This is the end of the system message, right? But I don't really want to make all those changes to the styling, but it's kind of this thing of your mouse on Create A restaurant review for a time pasta. Hey trying to copy and paste it, for example, imagine doing that, I put your cursor and you slightly have your cursor, go up above that it",
  "02 (2024-09-05 15:12 ): 25:00",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah, so I don't necessarily want to fix that because I think it's more of this bigger thing of how do we actually want the whole user interface to look? And I don't want to change that whole thing right now. so it just brings us deeper question of, we didn't really talk about those features. Do we really want those at this point, the copy? I feel like, Yeah, we have to kind of decide What actually we copying, because we're adding this HTML preview. I don't think it's bad copying the message content. I think for now, though, we should, either just have it always be there. Meaning don't have it when it's just hover over. it's always at the bottom and that actually signals It's the bottom of the message or just, frankly, not having them at all. Because if it's the copying, I think, because we're doing this rich HTML. People are gonna the idea of copying the entire message content just doesn't make as much sense as it does for other chats. And it's probably gonna be",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): A section in the future. The way GPT is copy this block of code or copied, individual ones. I don't see someone back.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Then.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah. When I copy this entire super verbose response, If they do, maybe they'll just use the mouse and I copy the whole thing and then I don't like this response, I think we want to Figure out how we're collecting feedback from users whether we're A/b testing or something like that. those are implemented though, So they're both actually working features. the dislike actually rights to the database And the copy actually copies the thing.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): What? Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): So I'm waiting to his idea because you already implemented them and it's better to get feedback leaving them in there but just having them don't have the hover over just always have them at the bottom. Right? So that way it's just like",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Start signaling to people like that's how I know I'm at the end of the system.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): The Institute.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): maximality that I was.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah, and then the other question is, while you're at that you're doing the styling? Do we want something that indicates that the system message is a unit, right? Because right now, it's part of the background and so there's not this clarity over the, kind of the end of the system message. So, either it doesn't do the same color as the user message,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): but even so it's a subtly different shade of gray. I mean, I kind of think having them both be bubbles of border radius, is the right way to do it. Yeah. just have that. Yeah. Have a background color.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): I think why not just make it the same as the user message because then we know the contrast is gonna be good with the white, right? Because that's kind of the thing with the",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Are not awesome.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah just do that charcoal or\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Actually.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): one of those but something that's dark it's probably gonna work better.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): For now and we'll talk about colors in a minute but",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): yeah, even more padding. Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): that makes up.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Even go. Yeah, I like 20.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): And he might.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah, I think that's good because",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Away is number five, default. Some sometime this message that Friday that I saw. Mmm.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): even so yeah, we'll deal with trying to get rid of HTML and stuff from the final message. But I'd rather have more space so that it's just more like",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Still have.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): but Go. Have a steel gray. Yeah. That we're gonna.",

  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Our Diamond textbook. Why it's very slowly?",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah. Yeah, I would actually use exactly the color from the user message. I think that actually makes more sense, already offset to the right.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): But there is no difference then.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): I know you're saying, let's talk about that later with colors and fonts and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): And however,\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): everything. But yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): but then the problem is and in the mobile, it's not like this. It's I guess full good presentation,\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Pick okay,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): I guess. I'm not sure.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): pick something\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): but pick something. That's readable There's this deeper problem that I really don't want this to look like chat gpt. We'll get to that in a second but don't spend too much time and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah, too dark.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah. Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): since it isn't gonna be what we go with, I'll put it that way just pick something that works.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah, that's good.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Whether problem is a code is also black,\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): then ask them, then if",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah let's okay keep it just put this into bread and push this and then let's talk about we'll move on to talk about that and what we actually want this to look like but this was more about just I wanted to make sure that just add this idea of having some background At all like that idea.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): And then testing that the buttons stay where they are. So that way it doesn't. Jump around.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah, yeah. That's yes.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Since.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Hey, pushed it.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah, we did. on say,",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): All Yeah Yeah, that was great. Yeah. Three double it's offset. The buttons fixed.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Button. Is that this okay?",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah. Yeah, always good.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): so now he's just doesn't jump around, which was really causing",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): What?",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Term mechanical so that's Okay so that Sells out, So, okay, now it's sort of the bigger. More like CSS really designed to kind of question which again I don't want to redesign the entire page even though at so in the long term here's what I really do. Think we just need to some places like hire designer and that way we'll just have someone even if they're part-time. Who's just thinking about these issues right in the two of us trying to design and kind of making these arbitrates, This was great for this because you kind of took chatting between. All right? We're gonna make it basically exactly chatting with tea, and that's a great starting point because",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah, I know, we've been working here. We don't want to spend that much time.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah, but Okay so that's gonna be the long term so I don't want to have us do too much design, but at the same token, there's two major issues. We've kind of do need to address. Even for. Now, the one is that this looks way too much, chat GPT even from a liability perspective,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): it looks like we're trying to like to come confuse people into thinking. This is an open AI product right and we need to. So there's that The second part is more straightforward, which is the design other than typography is good, but I know it's like we don't have any typography. Okay.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): ",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): And I think we want to and so kind if we divide into two categories which it's really like our three. There's typography there's color scheme and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): ",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): then there's these other kind of elements, And I think let me start with the other elements part\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): which I think actually is good. We've edited enough. And the whole point of this is we want it to work like chat gpt to the point\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Actually.",

They are like chat gpt someone because that's kind of the whole point that we want the flow to look like that. And the fact that we have a bar on the bottom, we have a message, we have. So those elements that are a lot chat to be tea. That's where we want to keep it the same like we just added in with one exception. I think we can just change this one right now. The diamond icon is really where it's Okay what do you guys trying to you? I really can't convince people. This is openai that they're in their open, AI account, right? and I think we can just find a simple alternative to that. That's just still a static image for now.",

  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): so it's not whatever the color scheme. I think what I want to do is just leave the car scheme the way it is because we tested all these contrast and we don't want to change too much right now, but again in the future I kind of want to make it the whole idea here is have our own brand, So when people come to our page thing, but again, I think the idea of getting a designer at some point and then say, Okay now it's actually design what the, page looks like after we've gotten user feedback after we fix a lot of issues. Maybe ai better a month from for now it's just leave it this gray color scheme. But again, that's what also not as worth things like",

  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): We'll leave the colors in the way. It is the bigger. So that's almost everything. Except for the final one, which is the fonts and the font sizes which are kind of related.",

  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): I don't want to play with the font sizes to you, so the fun which is fine. I know. It's like you just typography, wasn't it? It's all Ariel are mono space like all the defaults which is good to start with. But that was the one feedback I guess, it's really not that readable and making it bigger because Ariel's just not a particularly modern readable font. So here's another thing to start with. So this again, I don't want to spend too much time on typography just because you can be a rabbit hole, but I want to just get some decent fonts. what I have is in the front page, if you go to a goldsmith ai.com,",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): personally of I went through and grabbed some Web songs that were moderated, some research, and What are some good fonts for, they're readable. So another, We can't change this in the future, but if you go to the View source. And then, look at the",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): There's just a single in the hat. Not as I don't worry about that for a second, just go the head and look at the I. The not open up the head and look for the tag that actually imports.",

  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): I gone to the paradox. so,",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Go look at the CSS. Open the hat in the or. The head. and then go down to That's the Fonts.google API. Okay? That one I would just copy That not only has the funds that I'm using in here. But it's about like seven or eight fonts that are all good modern fonts, you can choose from and the beauty is because when they go to Goldsmith, they had calm, they're gonna load all these fonts, right? They'll all be cashed by the time they get to the chat and that we have more choice than just what I show on this page because the challenge is on this page, I'm only using two of those six or seven because it's just not a complicated page, right? So\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): The.",

  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): and we'll figure out later how we want. I'm not worried so much like the login page or something like that, we could improve that too. But Frankly, the readability just isn't that big an issue and it looks fine, but for now, at least as we play around with these fonts right now to choose, right? and then I'll walk when we walk through the ones and their purposes, right? So, in Inconsolata is the mono space font, so generally, that's what we should use for pre-incode to reply as a good default monospace, the work sands is what I always use for the title. So probably only use that for that, Goldsmith, Ai Chat preview because then it will also match Brand Wise okay, that's the title. and then enter and Poppins and Roboto are all just good general purpose.",

We're gonna override these. Don't use important because you never use important. I mean it just breaks. Have you been using important in other places? Because I know that that's part of the reason I think especially the sidebar I was noticing I was playing around with that to try and\u2026",

  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): That's ensure. yeah, the ones you usually have to overnight manually that don't come from body and maybe something like either roboto or open. Sans. Good choice is actually the input. So what's like message, Goldsmith ai, and then the other one is pre encode. You still want to be mono space. So for that one I would use insulata is the monosphate",

  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): And foreign size anything.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah, so the ones I saw, so set the default of font side for body from 14 at least a 16. I was playing around between 16 and 18. I think is correct because we don't have that many media queries, right? I don't want to add a lot of those now, but the tricky part is when people have really big screens, high resolution screens that aren't that big. 14 is totally unreadable. And you have to remember we're doing all this testing or the sidebar open. But most of the time, people really are like, Hey I've got to read all these words I'm not just scanning through this super quickly so it's very easy to developer to make fonts too small. On the other hand, we are doing a large projects in large format responses, so you know what? I want to make it too big and then for that I would just make",

  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah, and then the other one is actually line height, which because that has a big effect on readability for big blocks of code. Even just a slight increase in line height for the system message.",

I mean, you can do number of pixels but I would actually do just winehight one, is the standard line height. I wouldn't hard-code it in because then you have to change it. Unless it's for some reason, you really are trying to hardcode in line height here, I would like 1.2 2 is pretty big. It's double space somewhere between 1.2 and\u2026",

  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Maybe it's just too small. I can't tell the font actually changed. Maybe it's just that it's small.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): No, it did not change.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Xavier.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah, so I'm sure why that is an inter",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): I did not know what I did, not declare that. I",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): The body, I mean. Yeah what's override in the styles? What's actually setting the font family.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): yeah, It's the Button default.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Okay. Yeah. there's a Add button to one of those rules. There's all buttons by default are something could be enter. this where we could use",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah, I just say start with enter and then.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah. I think 16\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): 14 is right? No or 16.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): because area these are the titles of the whole thing, on the other hand, makes our previous smaller. So, we'll have to kind of Adjust accordingly. But",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Okay.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Because the other part too is I think for a feedback per second when stuff is too small, it's really the feedback you get is I can't read. This is too small. what? You're getting back when it's too big It actually gives you more complex feedback where you can see. Especially if I'm watching, people use it, what are they trying to do? And it forces us to use the screen real estate more effectively in all the other ways right now it's easy as you add features to just eat index screen real estate like we did in the bottom part today which is fine. It's just the reality but it kind of",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): And we're so used to viewing it with the sidebar open rather tools, And that's not really,",
  "03 (2024-09-05 15:12 ): 00:00",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): and the other part too, is it probably should very as at some point we'll add more media queries. Once we really go through the entire design. So that even really 4k screens have bigger fonts than just like 1080p and",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): and have at least, four or five break points rather than just one. but, You want to do that now? Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): No, it's not the system. I was too big. I wanted to see I would lose videos. I can learn that because then I guess like What you said? That REM thing. Daria.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Say that again.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Ram all the time. Yeah, yeah. I mean that's good to you. I mean we're using pixels like there's all yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah, I was one time thinking that thing only, I like, should we use audio pizza? Because I guess the M does It uses the screen size. I guess I will. Hmm.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah, to use these effective pixels that particularly for stuff like mobile. It doesn't solve the problem that for desktop screens. The REM generally is the same as a corresponds with pixels, So Re/m is generally better. I mean, but we'll worry about, I'd rather we get to the point All these breakpoints is where we need to designers. this is what she look like for here. This is which real quick for here and that'll be where we want to already. Have an idea of the issues. People are having using it and as we make our user interface more complex because it gives the biggest thing is, We haven't really talked about this too much that, for an application. this, it's really complex. It's all about officially using screen real estate, right? ours is gonna be more complex in a way than these other chat bots, that's sort of like, Claude, you're already seeing how Claude is running into a screen real estate issue because they're adding all these features and they're like, all right, does everything. Push everything outside the way and out of bar on the right bar on the left. And, \u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Mmm.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): it's like we More and more. So we'll have to figure out down the road based on as the AI gets better, which will take a couple months. Just say What's kind of the point here, what we should be showing to the users, and we'll figure that out for now. It's like we want to just err on the side of getting an MVP out that is kind of like a chatbot.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Not exactly that DVT but it's pretty close. I think we're for now. This is just perfect.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah, so I know it was fair. All those details as we go. Okay. So is that?",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): This thing was actually more.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): I think that's good. I mean, those dividers aren't that in,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): When?",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): they just kind of should fade in the background in a weird way, naturally. People know when they worked on what kind of. And so when they say today, yesterday we actually want that to be sort of emphasized, not really titles for that section more that the background that kind of tells you yeah, this dides. those little dividers of the grocery store for, check out things. I think that's pretty good.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah. but,",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah, here, push the changes you have so far and that way, we'll just make sure they all made it in the HTML or the CSS and",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): That one should have been because the body button that should already be set.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): This is not button is. Okay, but",

  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah.",

  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): No, no,\u2026",

  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): I don't change that now.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): you know what, frankly make this send button bigger because that one's really, really important. And I realize as the other users using it, because this full wit thing and now that they can hit enter, it's probably not as big a deal. But I kind of feel like having that just be pretty big is not bad. Even At 40 is pretty good.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Vegetable executor development or it looks.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah. Yeah. That's pretty big. Maybe. Let's I try 30. I compromise. Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): 300. Yeah.",
  "03 (2024-09-05 15:12 ): 05:00",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah, that's right.",

  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): That's right.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): but that's the point but not ridiculous. Yeah.",

  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): all right, one thing I know is, let's quickly change this, but there's mono insulata is for both message types, right? We wanted the,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): yeah, you",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): sorry I meant the line height for both message types we still want.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): are.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah yeah. the Sarah fought for the",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Okay.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah, buttons. Also text and\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah, those are good.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): For this Resources are like that. And this other change and\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): what things? Yeah. Okay.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): just,",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah, yeah. That's good.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Leave it inside that text itself. It was going like that.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Okay.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): So what I would say just get rid of the font family from the Dot message because the idea is we're already getting inconsolata from just the pre encode. So it's just like the default instead of Monospace for all. Monospace, but sure.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Then.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): And I mean that's kind of the other trade off. with the user message is trickier because we're not generating HTML. So we're just raw showing them. If they're writing pros, The problem with so model space is good for code because it lines up all the characters, but it's far less readable than sansara font on the other hand since we kind of expect people to be doing a lot of coding. I kind of think it's fine that we just have. they're messages, looks like it's code, kind of thing. it's exactly what you typed in and it does look in a weird way. I kind of looks a little bit",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Okay, I've got another idea. I mean, just maybe we don't need to do all this stuff but just I'll throw it out there. Just say no during But what if we take that should we have an icon for the user in their message? Right? using that user account icon, Maybe we'll wait till we actually have their name and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Not. I,\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): then if they have",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): I don't think that will record\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): because You know any yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): People generally know what they put.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): No like that. No anybody who sends the message, whether it's telegram or whether it's with. God. Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah, but that's what you got to remember, this isn't user to user chat, right? This isn't telegram. And this isn't SMS in the sense that",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): But then do if you send the message, there is no icon besides that.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah. Look at quad and catchy between, They don't even show these bubbles like that. and the reason is they generally align stuff for vertical to the,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah. Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): to the right at left, and the reason is you're not chatting, even though it's called chat, you're giving instructions, And you might be popping in entire blocks of code. So, I don't want to change that right now. You did it. You put it off to the right, that's fine. But There's a reason why it's not spoke really,",
  "03 (2024-09-05 15:12 ): 10:00",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): But you still quad doesn't do it that way. I think the way chat gpt does it tries to really emphasize this idea of chat to its own detriment, And that's one of the reasons why we use, Claude We get these Sutter feel subtle feelings. That it's better for bigger projects, Because it doesn't feel like you're just putting in some chat and having some conversation with it.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): It feels like what you are doing has durability as if it's like a play, or more importantly as if it's a document that goes back and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): The.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): forth where you give a big instruction and the problem is if someone they kind of know. They typed a message, but if they copy and paste in a document, it might not pattern match to them. is that to this obvious thing of it's just a box to the right? And because it's so big, those boxes can very easily take up the full width. It's not a thing. both sides are actually typing in a short message like a text message, Try to create to you. That's the whole idea, We have this metaphor, we have these history and we're trying to say with the new thing How do you play to someone's existing understanding of what it is? And then How do you actually make it new and this whole concept of chat being the thing that we're reproducing is getting to the point of the end of its longevity with AI right because that's great because you just have these messages but it doesn't",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): isn't really the goal is to be like I'm talking well to get some I don't want to make any changes right now,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah, yeah, I got that.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): but I was doing that idea that",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): No, it's ever.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Giving an icon to be like Hey we know it'll make more the reason I want to maybe hold off is it'll make more sense later when we actually have an avatar that people identify with whether it's the first letter of their name or an image of them, I kind of feel like with the icon we have now I don't really know that it will actually change much. You know what I mean? I'm someone being like, that's me because it has the generic person and I think so. I think it's just leave it like it is but it's something as we're later again. That's why I kind of want to like we think about that. I should be after we've done enough testing with real users that we understand how they're thinking about this and what the product really is. And then kind of really designing it not just by saying Hey chat hey I would make which is a great starting point like hey why are we making it the same way? We wrote that marketing car the sort of that fine print today we really don't want in the long term to be like, Okay, what's the generic a",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Because it misses the thing. On the other hand it means that it's not really. We need to kind of get to the point where we're focused on that or bring in other people that are focused entirely and that's a weekend focus on, these things and do not convince ourselves that",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): ",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): So that is great for now.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): No, no, that's fine let's see how they use. It gives that response and\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah. Exactly.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): then we change we will be hiring the design in the future. They will give us some nice idea What should I it actually look like. Mmm.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): But yeah, I mean I can tell you already from the feedback that I got which was I really couldn't tell weekly. I kept two or three times person asked so where's my Text, but we had all these other issues, With the scrolling and the other stuff. So it might not be an issue,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): but I do think in the long term, we'll be a design change. We want to kind of figure out what should that look like? but anyway, ll we figure that out for.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): This is a great job. we let me just go back and reload this and Check it. Yeah, I mean, I like all the fonts like",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): I mean, here's one thing that I'll say so even for now, if someone's Especially not only the fonts bigger. on this Imagine you're on a tablet or frankly, just That's like a small laptop really, We're wasting a lot of screen real estate to the right of the response particularly for code and stuff. Do we really need to make the width so small of the system message?",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): again, this is more of what I realized with the right left differentiating, who's typing, as if it's like SMS, it uses a lot of screen, real estate, right? If that makes sense, even though it does different chicken who's sending it. Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): God.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): It's a simple as one whichever one thing you can know, if we change the way we need to change the color,\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): something like that.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): I think that's perfect, yeah.",
  "03 (2024-09-05 15:12 ): 15:00",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): 15 change the color. I feel this feeling before that,\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Okay. Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): but Both the feeling is in the same level.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah, and so this is the challenge with gray scale to be honest. And this dark thing\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): ",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): which is you can change the color, the more you change it from black, the less contrast and readability, you're gonna have with white, right? And so change it, but",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): what about I mean to this, the other promise, a white scheme as opposed to dark is actually easier to mix other colors with yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): this month. Let's see Card.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): But yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): just,",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): The other one is we could totally invert it like We're not using much of the color spectrum here with this dark thing. What if we made the users background Super light with dark text, really flipped it around so that it's really, really clear that it's user, right? Because the dynamic range of color means we have Even gray scale dynamic range. we don't have any white backgrounds, And in this case, it's a dark color scheme, it would make really, really offset it, which is not bad for the user message.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): And actually doing it for the text area is not a bad idea. We're only the user messages and the text area have light backgrounds, with dark text, and that's really obvious that connection, right? It's like I type in this area. and then that appears in my messages and those are all exactly and everything that's dark is a system, everything that's light is me and then it's super psychologically. Clear, the relationship between dark on light is me light on dark, is the AI. Right. if you utility wise is incredibly effective,",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Right. Make it light this one and make it dark this one. Something like that. I",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): What I'm saying is make it so that the user message has a white background and black text. And make it so that.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Okay, okay.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): So that way, it's a total inversion.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): that's right.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): So that way it's really obvious the user messages exactly the opposite of the.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Mmm.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah, and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Of.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): then under color just like that.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah, to me this is very It's star Clear from a utility standpoint. It's like, yeah, there's no question.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Right.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): August.",
  "03 (2024-09-05 15:12 ): 20:00",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Presentation.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Check.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): That's over for water.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah I mean I like that because I mean it's really used as the screen real estate which we're gonna need and it's super obvious as you're just scrolling really quickly where the breaks between messages are you can scroll really fast down through a multi-term chat and be like alright that message breaks. Right. it forms an horizontal rule type of thing like going through.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah, I like that.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): And Just so nice having that extra width with code that actually runs beyond 80 characters, if you're like okay that one is 200 characters. Still, it shows up on the bank And again this differentiated from Chat GPT. So it's not like okay, that same colors and I think, Yeah. For now even having the message kind of be gray is fine.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Right.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): I think",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah, and then that's nice because it's sort of in the middle. It's like, this is how It's clearly not mixed up with either these page break entry,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): effective page rates or the responses.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): I do wonder now that they're lined up only just again throw this idea back out there and I kind of said we weren't going to do the icon for the personal account To the left there. It creates this symmetry, right? we have a circular icon for you. We have a circular icon for the AI and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): then actually have both the border is a small detail, but identical border radius for the two so that you have this symmetry but that's actually not as big. That's more of a subtle thing but",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 15:12 ): It's all like I was different. Let's try this thing on the local institution.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 15:12 ): Say that again.",

  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 14:15 ): Yeah, how was the demo like Judy.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 14:15 ): So JD we had to reschedule. So I'm not talking to him until Tuesday, but I went downtown on Friday and",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 14:15 ): Just had some people try it out at the barbershop, which actually worked out really well. And I went to a few other bars downtown DC to happy hours. They kind of just to get feedback from people because the nice part is since it On the phone, it's really, really easy to demo and everybody uses some sort of chatbot at work nowadays. So it's so two people in particular, I sat on top half an hour and tried out some prompts that they kind of use at work and they're pretty impressed, Even just considering that there's not that much to it yet. You know what I mean. It's but the good word is they understood even without me really explaining one guy in particular I was like we're using all these APIs we're using quite amazing kind of said you're using all three forward kind of looking like we just automatic prompt engineering and he was like was that more?",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 14:20 ): Serve and I was like, Yeah, that's kind of the trade-off. And I was like, so, we're gonna end up charging more and he was basically, Because if it works better, but it costs $100 a month. that's still totally reasonable. he uses four or five tools that he pays for, so he's as if it's doing my job for me, I'll spend about $500 a month on all these tools and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 14:20 ): All right.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 14:20 ): use four or five of them. so he and this other guy really kind of. Once I started telling them what? We just released they're really interesting and we're starting to each other about what they've been successful with and what's kind of tricky to get working. And so that was pretty good. One of them, I don't really know exactly does but he gave a lot of feedback. The other guy both work. She works in the government. He's also an adjunct professor of English, so, it's interesting to see him on both sides of it. seeing students use",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 14:20 ): And then he himself at work doing evaluations for people writing emails doing all this basic stuff at work. And even some of it where he's like, I use Chat GP just to see what it comes up with. So I understand what other people are gonna do because he's got eight people that work underneath them so I'll go in and I'll ask you to make me excuse for missing work, just to see what that looks like. Because he wants to know, if people are having to and I was like, that's an interesting use case and so it's interesting. You put in a lot of detail. If you just ask, an excuse it seems really generic, but if you put in some detail, it's pretty good. And so yeah, no, it's good to just get feedback from even a few people and there's a couple other people there that",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 14:20 ): I ran into The warrior that I had, spoke with three or four months ago, who is maybe interesting consulting but I didn't really try to hard sell them. I just talked about how we released this thing. I was like, Yeah, we got this chatbot, it's out there and you got my card so the good part is I think At least, it's easy to start a conversation. It's easy to get feedback from users because it's really easy to just be \u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 14:20 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 14:20 ): Yeah, I can use a chat but I think my takeaway though, it is hard to do? It's kind of what I expected but I noticed that if the prompts are relatively easy or straightforward writing and evaluation or just kind of doing this general business stuff, it's very very hard to differentiate it, right? Because it's like, I would have gotten a good answer with GPT or Quad or Gemini, one guy was like",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 14:20 ): He was like What do you think of co-pilot? And I was like it's not really the latest greatest but the fact that it integrates with stuff is hard to beat and he's like, that's the thing. I use it all the time because it's integrated with all of our documents and especially around here. I would say most companies and most government agencies are using Microsoft.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 14:20 ): Right.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 14:20 ): Three co-pilot 360, maybe not using copilot yet, but they're using Microsoft 365 and onedrive and \u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 14:20 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 14:20 ): that Microsoft salespeople selling them. It's very enterprise oriented. And so Microsoft has done a great job of getting particularly using 365 to kind of get their foot in the door and so it's I think for a lot of those places like getting co-pilot is kind of the obvious. Yeah. And then maybe some other companies are using Google stuff and so they're getting but that idea of just of course who wants to, it's integrated. so that was good, just kind of Yeah,'s, but just seeing that, generally everyone, I talk to is using multiple tools somewhere between. I would say, three to five tool there. People either are barely using it. I noticed or no, I use every day, all I do.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 14:20 ): My entire job has changed. All I do is use AI to do kind of everything and then I'm using three to five tools like one guys. he uses perplexity more than anything else, which makes sense\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 14:20 ): Have.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 14:25 ): because for, search oriented. So it seems like a reasonable mix right now is sort of like use copilot. When it integrates with your company's documents, chat gpt or quad probably more likely chat GPT at this point for just a general purpose, I mean putting in a prompt and getting some response like drafting email or something and then using some other tool depending on kind of what people kind of know about. And if it's sort of a lot of it seem like, Yeah, this one guy perplexity, other people. It's more like domains. It's almost talking about I do marketing and so, you just using whatever marketing platform he was already using, but then as I'm like, Hey, I integration or someone doing",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 14:25 ): In consulting, or he's on the other side, I was in the government but Just, those tools they have ai in them, so it's kind of use them but at the end of the day, yeah, it's interesting to see how",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 14:25 ): I think people are kind of fat when people use it at work and are like, this is what I do all day, even if they're and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 14:25 ): Okay.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 14:25 ): the one guy was like, Yeah, my company won't pay for any of it, they don't really understand. I'm trying to convince them girls ask. So I'm just paying out of pocket but if it's like, I don't have to do any work all day. I want to pay $500 a month, if they're paying me, $10,000 a month and I don't have to do it. He was saying it's about a 10x time saving for his job. I just go in. I do like an hour of work a day and then I play video games. That's the day, like other stuff like okay, yeah, I know that that makes sense and so I think that's in terms of the challenge of figuring out audience, because I've been thinking about that a lot this weekend. It's like on the one hand the audience has to be people that are using AI in a daily basis, Because that's sort of within every audience. So to speak of here's offer developers this, I think you have",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 14:25 ): More of this individual mentality about the current, state of AI. And yeah, there's the 10% of people that are just like, of course I'm going to use it for everything and I'm gonna invest my time to me. do learn better prompting and to discover other tools. And so just kind of use this every day and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 14:25 ): Exactly.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 14:25 ): get better at it and talk with people about it and those are the people that are either paying or trying to convince their company to pay for everybody, kind of like that,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 14:25 ): Big.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 14:25 ): these champions kind of thing.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 14:25 ): But then yes, everything. I think for so, it's nice to immediately be able to get feedback and that's kind of what's great about having a real product out there versus just talking about stuff is even some of the same people. I've been talking to for months, at the barbershop we the barber himself was like, okay can you let's meet sometime and maybe you can help me with the marketing stuff by just showing me how I can use ai to generate some marketing stuff. I was like, yeah, that's great. And, even this other guy was like, can I use this to write letters to my emails like friends and stuff. I was like, yeah. But I can tell his more doesn't use ai and so I was like, yeah. You could just do that already though. We're chatting. I was gonna give it a try,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 14:25 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 14:25 ): give him a car and I was like, Try it out. See if it works.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 14:25 ): So that was my first takeaway. I was just like let's get a little bit of feedback, it's very anecdotal at this point but the nice part is now it's sort of like if I go out and talk with people I can and get them to sign up. Really easily with this preview thing in person just to get a 10 people using it and kind of seeing how that goes. So that's at least good. The other takeaway has actually looked at the usage, like the cost, And man, so that's where I've been really kind of trying to figure out what we're going to do as we go forward now, because the two days that we were testing, we spent about five dollars a day on API costs. Which is pretty high. When you think about, I mean, we did a lot of prompts",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 14:25 ): You guys? Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 14:25 ): But the fact that it was just the two of us, it was mostly Who was testing that if you sit there all day, you can use five dollars in a day, very easily and the fact that we're not doing a lot of the features, right? We're not doing search, we're not doing the code interpreter. We're not doing sort of any automatic feedback or anything like that. We're just doing six static prompts so that I really is gonna be a big thing with the AI is really figuring out okay what's the right price point? What are we giving people, at that price and then How are we actually making this efficient? And using these different mods? I mean, at the end of the day, I think a lot of what we're doing right now. We could actually do with four. Mini, so remember, I'm running all the prompts with four. which is about third,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 14:25 ): that's",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 14:25 ): 30 times more expensive for a mini. But I will say the results like I did a few prompts this weekend.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 14:30 ): That generally I thought got much better results than I did with either Claude or Chat GPT which is in and of itself. It's not every prompt a lot of the prompts if they're simple. I was getting exactly the Internet I mean okay did the It wrote the email it wrote the thing, but when I was asking more research oriented stuff that wasn't recent Or longer form stuff like the fact that we're just doing this, multiple problems, generally is leading to very long output, which is in and of itself like a differentiator this way, The problem with that is that's what's actually costing so much. So when I went to the usage it's not the input token which is usually the case in a weird way once you get longer and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 14:30 ): Yeah. Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 14:30 ): longer chats it's like okay the input becomes dominant but here it's like the output.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 14:30 ): Caught the output tokens are about equal to the input tokens even though we're feeding the output back into the input of future problems. And therefore the cost of the output is three times higher than the cost of the input that the good part of that is it actually won't really cost quadratically more as people kind of do longer I was really worried. My first saw it and I was like my God it's costing us 10 to 15 cents per chat and each chat we're doing was only two prompts, basically? Right? That I was like, my gosh, this is gonna become dollars. But the reality is like, if we have triple the length, it's probably only gonna double the cost, right? Because it's gonna make input and output about equal because the output is already sort of at what the maxum output size generally is without giving special instructions to be a really long output or something. So that was interesting. yeah, the other",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 14:30 ): Back, I got from everybody, basically, which is actually a good thing, is that the number one feature that they like, you need is integrated search, none of the other stuff. Really matters in the short term uploading files doesn't The audio transcription doesn't Ask them about all those things specifically they're But at the end of the day I need to know that if I'm trying to do something that it's researching on the Internet exciting, those sources and that is coming up with stuff that's recent because it's not doing that, that every person individually was kind of like it's not doing that,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 14:30 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 14:30 ): I just can't use it because at the end of the day",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 14:30 ): There could have been something that came out and it just becomes not usable for most tasks and especially the differentiated ones, the ones where it's Write me an email to this person, maybe it doesn't matter, but it's like, Okay, that's not really going to, differentiate this and then make it cost more money. So it's those good feedback, the other one. Yeah. Was like, pricing, I just kind of threw out there to people, a hundred dollars a month. I figured that would be a good way to feel out what and I think that seems Pretty reasonable and nobody really balked at that and they're like if it's better, I mean that's kind of the thing it's like okay that's more expensive but",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 14:30 ): People want the thing that's gonna work the best if they're using it. And so I think with the elevator pitch kind of being like this is better and then people are sort of like Why is it just magically better? And the answer to it's better because it's more expensive is actually not a difficult thing to understand. It's about the easiest, where any technical knowledge or anything on ai to be \u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 14:30 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 14:30 ): it just cost more. And so then in a way that that's why realize I was talking to people, I never said we're gonna have a 20 dollar a month plan. And I realize, the more people is talking to the more that what? I don't think we can afford to have a 20 dollar month plan because of the actual cause\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 14:30 ): Yeah, from meditation idea.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 14:30 ): but you at all together. Yeah it makes any sense because it undermines the whole",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 14:30 ): Pitch that we're just better because we're more expensive. So then I don't need to explain some complicated technical differentiator or something else, It's just so I' I think we definitely should be doing monthly subscriptions. I mean, after talking to people, that just seems like the only model that they understand. that makes sense. I think doing 50 a hundred, and two hundred dollar plans. then it really frames is there's more expensive if most people are picking 50, That's fine. That's still significantly more expensive and therefore allows us to do, Multi-stage prompting. And then the tricky part is and this is what I think we have to kind of go, over the next weeks or even a couple months is kind of like as we build out the tool in the more detail and more the AI stuff especially trying to figure out okay how are we framing? What the capabilities.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 14:35 ): This are. And then, how are we framing? Sort of these throttling or whatever restrictions we have? Because, in for 50 dollars a month, they're not gonna be able to use it unlimited, right? I mean, it's gonna have to be actually.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 14:35 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 14:35 ): Pretty limited at $50 a month. I had an idea, if we were just doing chat like we're doing, if the idea was basically like we have, this is the product and nothing about it's gonna change. And our goal is just to sell it, That's a good starting point. I frankly think just having a certain number of chats per day",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 14:35 ): Is the easiest thing to understand because that throttles it in a way that you can't really use it up in a couple days.'re, I paid $50 and I just overuse my resources pretty straightforward. It's like, I get so many chats per day for $50. I get, a little bit more than double, for a hundred, a little more than double that for 200. It's like, all right by use my chat, it's pretty obvious. If you're like, Wow, this is really great, but I keep putting the limit. I'll upgrade to the next version and so up to you, get to the higher price point so I think that's not a bad way to frame it. then each chat is kind of limited in its length or it's the price it's still kind of tricky. again if we're just doing it what we're doing now it's actually pretty sure because it's a finite number of prompts using specific models. Right. So we really really know actually with the prices given the number of tokens and so we can basically say yeah, you only",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 14:35 ): Really get 20,000 tokens or something like that. And then you say, Okay you get Three prompts per day at the $50 month, plan, right? And eight prompts per day for $100 a month and twenty not prompts a whole chats that, you can do only five or six, kind of prompts so that I think it's a reasonable, starting point to kind of think about it. But I realize, in reality, the whole point is we want to add all these features that then we've got to really add some of those features. I think that's actually the kind of from the AI side. And from the feedback feel seems like the obvious adding search and then understand the cost involved in search. And then having that be",

I, really went out and was all right. Awesome, I got this thing out. I can go and talk to people about it, all kind of enjoy. practicing the elevator pitch and\u2026",

  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 14:35 ): and seeing how so I'd say the big takeaway it's great. the fact that we needed to do that push to get something out there and it worked well, I mean the other part was a little bit worried not that it would have been so bad but gosh, I break it while I'm in front of somebody but I feel like, okay, it happens. We'll fix, I mean, it wouldn't have been the end of the world\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 14:35 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 14:35 ): but it didn't break. When I was with one person. the first person I totally forgot that,",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 14:35 ): I had been going to the old Dev version so much that when I put it in it Autocompleted to the diver version and then I went in and I was like Why is it this working? And then I realized after three attempts to log in and seeing shoot Dev that gold team and it's like okay that's not the right version. that's not the live thing. What is that working? So once again on the live thing that was good and it didn't break and users I was able to show people and it worked well in the phone. What I'll say that? Specially for short prompts. Yeah. The feedback I did get from people about. That is one guys, it's convenient to do, some simple chatting, on the phone, but when I'm actually using it for work, he's like I always want to get on my desktop and it's even sometimes. he'll be like, I have chat gpt on my phone, put in some query, some prompt get a response and then have to",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 14:35 ): Impatient email it to himself to I get it open on his desktop in Gemini or something so it's integrated with this other stuff so this girl is awkward flow and so he's in reality it's so much more convenient. If he's doing longer prompts or\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 14:35 ): Okay.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 14:35 ): using any existing materials to do internal in the desktop and it's like I'll do it on my phone when I'm waiting at the barbershop but he's a lot of times, it's just asking stupid question. Yeah, it's just kind of like messing around just for something to do not like getting real work done. So I do think that from a mark from a sales perspective, it's really good to have the phone app because what we have now a responsive design so that people it's usable on the phone.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 14:35 ): My God today.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 14:35 ): But I do think that",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 14:40 ): we should recognize that, most of the people that are gonna be paying, I think we're gonna want them to evaluate it on the desktop, especially if they only get a limited amount of usage and the goal is to be like, Hey, we want you to ask really hard questions be able to see comprehensive results, Designing an entire website and then it, does the whole thing.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 14:40 ): And does a more complete job.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 14:40 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 14:40 ): The other one is the voice because I asked him about that. As a couple people about that. I was like, Do you use the voice in GPT? And the consensus I would say every single person I ask I think that's either two or three people but they were all not really. It just doesn't work well enough on open AI. They're sometimes it can be a little bit handy to add something really off the cost and it's kind of nice but they're even on the phone typing something in, it's just the only way to get it to have the right words and it's really frustrating. So I have some prompt that's wrong and then have it, sit there and \u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 14:40 ): Okay.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 14:40 ): work on this wrong thing. So, I didn't my see and then it didn't work on my phone so I couldn't really demo ours with them.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 14:40 ): But That's the other part two that we'll see as if a couple of these people think I give out five cards to people that I talk to about it and it was nice and easy to just go to Goldsmitha.com, there's no QR code or\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 14:40 ): Okay.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 14:40 ): anything. That would be. Maybe I'll get the cards with the QR codes printed by, just hopefully, even one or two of them actually signing up and trying out. We'll kind of see what they put into it and what the results are. But they were I will say the format and everything.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 14:40 ): It was good, and all the cases that luckily when I tried wasn't code generation so it didn't run into any of the problem of not rendering the markdown or something. every example that I showed them they were also really surprised. I said it was gonna take a really long time, that was the other part. It was like, the latency is longer. They were maybe because I framed it but everyone was kind of like that didn't take too long or maybe because the prompts are asking weren't super complicated. So they're relatively short responses but I think they were expecting. I was like, it's gonna take this really long time. It all come, and then 15 20 seconds later, it comes in. And again, they weren't just saying they're waiting, like we were talking. So it wasn't the real kind of use case.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 14:40 ): But that's a good sign. And then the biggest thing is one of them person asked they have to do self-evaluations in the government and he's like, I always use chat GPT to write me a template for a self-evaluation that will get an outstanding review because the reality is the government has a rubric right for scoring it. So when you do yourself evaluation, you always should make it so that you get a hundred percent, right? Because you can do that. And so that was the one where he was like my God I mean and it was true it probably generated a couple of thousand tokens of output from this very very simple prompt that was just right and outstanding self evaluation for a GS 15 and the federal government and it's like all right, go ahead and then it was like every section had a template and it did this super long form so I do that's the part that I think is actually",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 14:40 ): As long as there's a good correlation between someone, that's a simple question. It's pretty fast if they ask for a lot of output then that it produces a lot of output waiting 30 seconds or a minute. If at the end of the day it's gonna take them 10 minutes to review. The output is totally reasonable,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 14:40 ): Mmm.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 14:40 ): Because if it generates 2,000 words, you've got to read those 200 words that takes",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 14:40 ): yeah, then",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 14:40 ): Yeah, so The good takeaway is. Yeah. I feel really good about just that initial, feedback and the fact that it's live means I can get more. So, I think the biggest thing is we want to kind of shift in gears to what we should do. the biggest thing I think is to take a breath and we don't need to go at the same pace, we were, what I mean, those last years for pushing because if we keep trying to be we've got to just keep pushing to get, what I mean. this next thing in it'll kind of perpetually just be that and that I think the trick is really need to",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 14:45 ): Do work on it. And then also have time that to take a step back and think about, okay, what we actually want this to be, because I think, the chat is the perfect starting point because everyone knows how to use it. It was really straightforward for both of us. what I mean to build our pieces because it's like, take captivity and implement. That was a lot of work but straightforward and then, for me to do the AI, I was also like, okay just do five or six stage prompt and not super complicated. And so I think that was great. But then I think as we go forward, we want to take a few weeks of just us talking about it before I'd like and commit towards building some specific.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 14:45 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 14:45 ): You know what I mean? next thing and in the meantime though, I think there's plenty that we can kind of talk through and work on related to simply kind of like taking the Web platform now that's in production and just sort of like",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 14:45 ): At the margins kind of outside reducing our technical that or getting a better deployment in or fixing a few, kind of issues. So that way we're just kind of like working at a slope and that way, also once we have an idea of what we're trying to build, we might have another big push. You know what I mean? And, three weeks or, months, we might, as well just kind of, not try to scramble to pick. There's all, And that was The feedback it wasn't like, man, there's 10 obvious things that people like, you fix You need to fix this and even solve the ones that I noticed. When I was using it, because there's features in chat, you repeat that. You just get so used to the number. One thing I noticed was man, I wanted to go back and edit previous chats. that was one with.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 14:45 ): Okay.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 14:45 ): Okay, I put this shedding but I realize with our cost model.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 14:45 ): It might never actually make sense to add that type of tree structure because",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 14:45 ): But yeah I know the problem with the edit also I don't feel it's correct if you want to really go two steps about three step or then I did then it's not effort you write the new prompt again and\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 14:45 ): Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 14:45 ): paste it to you then you out for that's better. Actually then it",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 14:45 ): We have, but I think as we go and this will think about on the next few weeks but I don't think we want to encourage that flow either which is starting a new prompt because you lose. It's so expensive for us to have done all the work to come with the first version that we need to have a better seamless way to modify the results of the previous one and reuse kind of steps which generally I think",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 14:45 ): I'm winning more and again we'll take our time to think about this but why weaning more towards this idea. That if you feel like you should have edited the previous one, right? You really need to communicate with the AI to go forward into the future of what you both want it to do going forward. And depending on the use case, that can look really different if you make a mistake, you literally typed in the wrong thing, And it's like,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 14:45 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 14:45 ): No that's a keyword. I typed in the wrong thing Then I think we need some way to not go back and edit the previous prompt but actually be able to sort of write a modified version of the new prompt. But in a way that's not in a tree, kind of thing but as going forward and a lot of cases, it might actually be more with a feedback where the AI has a follow-up question that you can answer, Did you mean this? And I think with our car, that's what I was thinking, too. With the cost structure that.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 14:45 ): Might actually make sense to start with questions rather than doing all the work. Because if it's basically, okay, it's gonna cost us, 20 or 25 cents to produce. This really long output, we really can't afford to kind of just do it and then have the person back. now that I see those results, that wasn't really what I meant I think we want to do instead is gonna be you ask to build a website for a restaurant or something. It doesn't just go ahead and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 14:45 ): And got.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 14:45 ): churn out 5,000 lines of code. It has a full question.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 14:45 ): ",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 14:45 ): It's like, What type of restaurant is this do you want this to look like a very generic website with a hero and here's a structure, maybe we'll,",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 14:45 ): Put in a question for him being are there any changes to this? You want. Here's the plan and then have the user be able to kind of respond to that more in a natural chat. Way that a human developer might, it's only gives a basic idea. And then the developers not just Okay, I'll build that. they might ask a few questions. Okay. I didn't understand that part\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 14:45 ): Right.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 14:45 ): where you said, you wanted of cartoon pictures of food. that doesn't seem like that makes sense for a restaurant, the Prince no, I didn't mean I just like little icons on the side, And then no, it's still gonna have real pictures of food.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 14:45 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 14:45 ): Okay, I need to clarify that. but I think this is where over the next few weeks. I've got some ideas floating around, but I they'll be enough work to build out some basic stuff that I have in mind. So basically, don't take a step back. Here's what I think, we need to build over the next two or",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 14:50 ): Weeks as we then also kind of talk about what we want, the AI to be. I'm just really three pieces that are really obvious. So for the AI part it's search and the code interpreter, Search, I already kind of got, 50% the way that I got the headless browser running and it's getting the search results, I'll have to then, just write a little API for that. That'll be actually really easy like a single endpoint and then more importantly, then actually play around with the cost of the prompts. So for the AI part, that they'll be the code interpreter, which I'm gonna use that resist. So that should be pretty straightforward and I'm gonna do these before. I focus on really running the evals because we know,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 14:50 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 14:50 ): I know we need those things and we kind of need them to run the evals So there's no reason to kind of like",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 14:50 ): Worry too much about the details of the prompting while we're still doing that. And then the other one that I want I'm gonna integrate. And I really realize I have to do now is capturing the costs on app per prompt basis, so that's actually available to your side right to the application.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 14:50 ): .",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 14:50 ): So we can store it in the database, So at the very least, every time, the user puts in a prompt, And the AI sends that message back. Right? We should add a field called cost, which is just the dollar amount that we spent to run that prompt even if it's not any more granular than that to start with, and that'll be easy to just on my end, just use the",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 14:50 ): Use all the tools that are built into the open AI API and just kind of get those costs and just put them in a cost. so those are the parts I do on my end and then for your side of it, There's kind of two separate pieces I think. And one we'll have to work on together is just kind of taking our time to figure out what do we actually want production and development to look like more importantly, It's not even like what production should look like. It's like, How are we going to do staging and deployment and test it in a reasonable way. So we're not spending too much. Time writing automated tests that are brittle, but that we have a lot more.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 14:50 ): Go more of a strong guarantee that when we push in a production that the site isn't just either broken, When we push it, which is kind of easier to find out, but it's like a pain or harder is sort of like that it seems to work. And then we go ahead and start using it and it breaks and we'll kind of talk about that. And then also if there's any changes we really want to make to production to make that more reliable. but I think that's something where we've got to just kind of work through it together. Also, I'm kind of decide how I want to work. I think the other part is that any you can work on mostly independently, is We need an internal dashboard. Basically now is kind of before we add any more features just to even get a sense of Have our users signing up, for every user, How many chats are they doing? And then being able to look and see, Okay, What are the problems? What are the responses? How",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 14:50 ): Really want to actually build that but I think at the very least, some really starting with just the most important features first and the number one feature is just something as simple as an admin tool that has a list of users and even account of prompts just to be \u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 14:50 ): Now.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 14:50 ): all right we got people, I mean who's sign up for it and if we just kind of have a dashboard that's just like a simple table. This is where we don't want to Make it too pretty, right? at the end of the day just having something that's really simple that we can use. West Focus on CSS whereas Let's use your facing. It's good to have the amount we did was perfect for this week That's a table,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 14:50 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 14:50 ): I'm very table oriented because the end of the day we're gonna be more likely to change stuff and add a zillion fields and almost just being like, it, takes what's in for now or the database is so small, with the exception of the problem of the",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 14:50 ): chat to some cells which are really long, everything else, it probably can be as simple as show that you entire user's table. as a table in the browser as an admin tool. and then we'll figure out how we want to secure that, and everything to make it a little bit, doing it more secure than the way, user sign in but there's a lot of opportunity to kind of build out.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 14:55 ): Yeah some basic visibility and then once we have a good way to make updates where we feel good that we can put something in a production and update it there we can start doing a few small changes just to kind of test that out. There's really only one thing that I noticed that seems like an obvious kind of improvement and that is with the auth flow if you basically have to log in every time because you have to have a one-time if I go to goldsmith i.com and I'm already logged in",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 14:55 ): It redirects me to the login page again, right? So while I can manually go to chat Goldsmith that I come slash chat. If I just go to Goldsmithai.com right? Because it's on the business card. I just kind of go back there whatever you have to log in basically and I think just simply checking to see. Hey is there a session when you go to the chat that goes with that. Calm. like index, they're like, yeah, if you have a valid session, don't redirect to login, redirect to the chat page, and that way users can kind of keep using it for the week that they're session is valid without, walking in every single time. They kind of just leave and then",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 14:55 ): But there's no really because we're trying to have people use it for the first time it's not like there's any time pressure to have that. Yeah it's not like it's like a hot fix or something is broken it's like that I think would just be a good use case to kind of say okay once we get a good handle on how we want production to work and everything, then we can try that out as a standalone modification and then we were able to push in a production and it works seamlessly or we had these issues because I guess is the first time we do it, we'll have issues. Even if we kind of 90% of the things we kind of work,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 14:55 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 14:55 ): at the King System, we'll see what that is. And then we'll the biggest one. I thought. I mean, if we don't get into that concretely, it's the database and the environment variables, and everything and making sure the process or Pm2 is running with the right environment variables and all that, they tend to be the issue. And what I found in the past is even a test script that simply",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 14:55 ): Ask that you can connect to the database checks most of the boxes in terms If you can connect to the database most of the time almost everything else works, it's that's actually usually the tricky part because it means the environment variables are correct. It means the database is actually running. It means it's connected to the production database.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 14:55 ): the other part is we might want to, I think now is probably a good time to switch to a managed database because right now there's not very good backup and roll back like capability. Yeah, we have this database that's just running on the same instances, the application server, and sure it gets backed up nightly, but there's no transaction level back up in case we need to know what I mean? there's transaction level back up, that should be built into the instance, But if an instance fails, we'll lose a days worth of database transactions. Whereas it's only 15 dollars a month for the managed postgres in digital ocean and it just means okay we're taking over a port to this other database and that, it's kind of a slightly different pattern but I figure at some point we're gonna want to do that anyway, right?",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 14:55 ): because more You can if you ever really want high availability really need that type of a database.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 14:55 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 14:55 ): It's running on multiple nodes and there's absolutely no reason why we want to manage that every cloud service manage databases for the beauty of using postgres, as you know, that you're gonna be able to get one and once we switch and switching it over is usually the part that breaks it. And so we might as well do that as early as possible before we have users and then just get that set up. Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 14:55 ): He actually, yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 14:55 ): That's right.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 14:55 ): And the other part of prayer is we probably want to This is where it's more like Call it tactical that but right now we have some stuff that's on the servers that really could be in version control, and I think that's one thing that'll make it really clean is basically pulling everything into version control that we can. And then basically only having the environment variables have keys and a single environment variable, that'll be called environment or something. That's either production or development or staging if we decide to add staging. That's kind of the other part, which we might decide. We need to add a staging.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:00 ): Environment. that's usually kind of necessary, Because you need to be special to make development efficient. But then can't really just take that and put it directly into production or it might break. Right. So you basically have staging that looks identical to production",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:00 ): You put stuff in a staging, you run all these tasks, To make sure it works. And then you kind of have identical procedure to move to staging by being identical to production other than the actual variables themselves like host name and everything. It's then at least we know we're able to change the host name and then we change it again to the real one. If they're. Yeah, we would have run to an issue. The first time a lot of this is If it weren't for cost, I'd probably just be like, Okay, let's have everything, be high availability, and have staging and production and development, but very quickly,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:00 ): Everyone.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:00 ): run into it it's $500 a month because you're like Okay we need to load balancing servers. We need two application servers right to AI Server.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:00 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:00 ): Do headless servers and then at three No database and an admin slash monitoring server and so quickly, you're like we need seven or eight services and any of the identical setup for staging.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:00 ): The other thing with staging is a lot of time, you can spin it up ad hoc when you're getting ready to do a deployment, it just adds another little level of complexity, but the idea of saying, you don't keep those resources around you spin up, you snapshot those resources and then you spin them up then you do the staging You then deployed a production which is live because I mean I just talk out loud. I thought about a little bit but not too much the question of Should we do Green deployment? Or should we do a sort of custom deployment right? Blue green deployment is where you basically create new resources when you're putting it pushing into production and I would say that over the last decade that's become the standard especially with stuff like Docker it's sort of",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:00 ): How that flow is kind of meant to work and it is pretty clean, Because what you do is you don't really have a staging environment, What you do is you create a your staging resources that are identical to production, And those are the blue resources and they're in parallel to production, which is green, Once you've run the automated test on the staging resources. exactly those resources with these versions of software and everything actually run and pass all the automated tests. You then just do. Usually it's like with a either. You can be internal DNS or more with reserved. IPS is the fastest you just switch over.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:00 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:00 ): So the resources point from the green to the blue and the beauty then is if it fails let's say you actually have some domain name problem that staging was fine but for some reason right the different domain name, the real domain name, not the sub domain.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:00 ): Doesn't work or something. You switch back to the old green resources, so you swap, blue to green and then you can swat blue and green back. If there's some problem before you destroy them right?",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:00 ): Okay.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:00 ): Then you run the test again, input in the actual production, environment live, and then if all the tests pass there, the thing is live. The monitoring says It's all working. Then you go ahead and you you wait an hour. Let's say something like that and then you just scrooy the previous version of the production resources, right? So it's like a very elegant high reliability pattern and you don't run into problems of running updates on software. Especially, Netflix for example, famously they send kill signals to random servers all the time. They're mentality is never let a server run for more than a week or something because then you can have problems of stale software and updates.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:00 ): Always have all the updates running on a new server. Spin that up and replace all your resources. So, no individual resource. Is that important? Here's what I'll say practically though,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:00 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:00 ): it's challenged, you need a lot of test coverage to have that make sense, Because you really have to rely on the test coverage. Versus if we end up doing something manually, that's in the production environment and then it's like okay, that works. We need them really know what it is. We have to have this balance, that's a lot more than we've done the past, on being Make sure production is guaranteed to work. But on the other hand, it has to be balanced because we can't really rely on automated tests because then we have to build up a lot of automated tests. Those are very brittle when you're changing fundamental things about the architecture rapidly going to postgres as a cloud managed resource. Right? Okay all your\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:00 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:05 ): Yes right not really be helpful.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:05 ): And that's the other part too, is more test writing. So I mean that's probably the biggest thing which is if we ever get at some point where we want to have time to think about what we're building, we can always just write more tests as a useful use of time to have better coverage over the basics. And so I think that's really kind of are I mean, I kind of was like, this weekend I'll figure out what the next step is by realizing. All right, we don't really need to figure this out, day one. You know what I mean? we need time to just kind of think about and kind of talk through stuff that this one kind of like we were doing a couple months ago. and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:05 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:05 ): in the short term when we're not doing that we're actually okay what can we really kind of work on? I can be adding search, you can be working on a dashboard because the dad that as far as the dashboard can be just a separate application.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:05 ): Just directly talks to the database, And it can be dumb simple, right? It can just be like, I made the page as a table make a dedicated node server just for admin and then just have we want something to display users. we want this and we can just kind of talk through what features we want as we go. and the other thing too is you can work out like you can use as an opportunity to maybe",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:05 ): What your brothers, competitive analysis, What are all these startups out there? Where is that is current moment kind of look like because the more that's just valuable Internet of itself at this point. So we can kind of figure out how we want our ai to differentiate itself. Because I realize I think what we have is really good but I think we have to be more aggressive at figuring out what we want it who the audience is and how we want it to be different and how we want to frame that difference so that we can charge these higher prices, That's the one thing I know. Right now that I do want to thank you. That's almost like this is the raise on tetra what or the, unique selling proposition where we want to call it of ours. Is in this weird thing, it's more expensive it seems like a weird unique talking about position\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:05 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:05 ): but that is an instant differentiator. And then we just have to back into",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:05 ): One thing I realized would chat, Yeah, as I was talking with people this week Chad is actually really challenging because it's so open-ended, right? So, just pure chat, like we have now the challenge is gonna be like, we're gonna have a thousand different use cases. If we just try to do more of the Lean startup approach, Of just, okay, users use the product, right? You\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:05 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:05 ): And then we Look at the National. What do they do here? And a company like Open AI? And probably it's like, they have a lot of employees to handle this myriad of use cases. whereas we've got to figure out okay, what's that s I think a clear one is we should focus on Web development itself. because that's a use case,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:05 ): Mmm.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:05 ): I've done some but you've been spending a lot of time using Quad and open and Chat GPT on the, particularly front end develop",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:05 ): but, also back in development and it's a case where it's really like big the projects or the right size that they're actually doable and completable and yet they're big enough that these chatbots have real weaknesses patching together. a full web project and the ability to kind of make me a restaurant website and have it just make a whole restaurant website and preview that whole thing live.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:05 ): Is doable, It's not this unreasonable thing and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:05 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:05 ): think that's an obvious. What other one is games again? I don't really think you want to get professional game developers. So I don't think games we want to be like the core thing, where it's like, someone's paying $200 a month because they're a game developer. And they're using this develop games because game production games, I played a few games this weekend, too. but I was off but they're so design oriented. They're so testing for fun and having an element, whether a game is fun or not. Is a really actually big challenge compared to the correctness of a web application or the correctness of game code to get, something going. But on the other hand, what I like about games is they don't every type of developer at some point, has made a small game for fun, right? So for",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:05 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Uppers being the audience and it's very visual. It's very like a good test case, And so I think it's something that allows us to demonstrate the application. So which I do think going forward. If we're only gonna give what I'm thinking is if let's say you get x number of chats, And I did the pricing yesterday to kind of figure out. if we did, you get three chats day, eight chats a day in 20 chats, a day for the three different levels. And then we said You get a trial. When you sign up with your email, you get 10 chats for free as the trial, You can use them in any period of time, just 10 chats and each one does a significant work, It's really important that we have those pre-stage prompt buttons, everybody else, they're really, really good. The perplexity one. I really like one of their questions was basically unique selling proposition. It was like, what sets perplexity apart?",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): What makes for Park City different and that's brilliant because it's rather than putting that in some marketing page and people don't go to, it's such an easy thing just to click that button have it, even if it's a fake, I mean it's kind of built in,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): but the other one is a game, Because just being Build me a working game Web game, right? And then the beauty of games too is if it's the only thing we really worry about is building a end Web game, right? That actually, leverages the fact that for building free, all these tools for Web front end in the first place. We're not really developing some separate technology stack to support, the ability to build just like a JavaScript front end game. and that way whereas if we did real game development, there's all these third party tools like Unity and F Mod and a zillion other tools that people really use. And I don't want to go down that rabbit hole because",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): That's a niche in and of itself, To be like, okay, we're actually targeting game developers the back end for Web. I think is trickier because of security of saying, How do we actually run that in a way that allows people to test it? I think where it would be valuable is we're busy giving them very detailed instructions and scripts to run on a cloud to set it up on their own. So I don't think we really want to run back and resources ourselves, Which in theory, we could say? Yeah, we'll give you a development I, we'll run your node script on our server, but the security risks of that are way bigger than posting front end code.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): And we don't have this capability at this point to build all the sandboxes required, to kind of be like,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:10 ): ",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Yeah, you can actually host and you don't want people to go into production with it, Because then it uses real resources. So what I'm thinking,",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): is we have front-end flat and then front end game, which are kind of actually not that different technically and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): then for back-end we're working on which I kind of actually like the idea that rather than",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Worrying about AWS and Google Cloud platform for an azure that all have these very specific services. That then a lot of it is configured in the UI, right? And s hard you can automate it with, scripts and everything, but that's very specific to that. So we'd have to individually support those services. The idea of building against digital ocean because if you build against that set of resources, those researchers are available in the other class, you have instances that droplets, you have in, those are three, you have that. But if we basically just assume, You're gonna have some S3 story, you're gonna have some server and have it be more focused on Here's detailed instructions and then very opinion. That's the other part that I realize instead of the back and being Whoa, How would you like to host? This haven't just, by default assume they're actually gonna host on Digital Ocean,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:10 ): .",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): it's a really safe,",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Kind of thing. And the idea is a scale, doesn't matter if they're trying to develop a back end, in this case and then if they want to port it over to AWS or something, fine, they can That's a different problem. But for us just be able to be like, okay, we've built you this front end, we then have these API endpoints. And then we have this very very detailed instructions of even being go to all this link set up an account like copy and paste the API key here. I'll ask you what it is and then maybe I haven't decided that we want to do secrets management or if we want to keep that on there. but basically then the idea is then they just get scripts and then individual bash instructions. So it's like ssha and here's your command just paste that in your terminal and then just scp this file over that you don't copy and paste in a notepad or something. So we'll figure that as we go. But I think I'm back and having",
  "01 (2024-09-09 15:10 ): 00:00",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Backend and front end so the people can really do. Full stack was something like that.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): That I think it's gonna be the killer app for us. And then some of the other. I think leaning more into the technical stuff. I think, where we actually want to avoid is legal and medical. I think we should just avoid those for the time being with a simple.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): If somebody asked for legal or medical advice, hard code in some answers that are just like You don't give medical advice because safety liability wise that's good and it's just not something we really have, I mean the ability to evaluate or expertise and let people use openai or search or something that they really just want to know as a consumer something about how and if they're really in the healthcare profession we're just not a good fit anyway.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): so what was the other one? So when it comes to the more technical stuff like semiconductor and embedded system that I think in the long term, I like that as a differentiator because I've just found over the last few years. it establishes this level of technical credibility and it's the foundation for application software and security in the long term. But what I think is, I'm gonna treat that more as almost just a side project Hey, if I decide, in a month or two yeah, I want to see how some of this embedded system stuff works. it'll be kind of like a project that I do because it's very specialized. And if we get somewhere in the future, it'll be good. But I'm not gonna put any time pressure. If it takes two years before, we have some semiconductor. thing that's fine. I do think it's so much more of a differentiator because it's so much",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): A niche industry but it's a big money industry but that means the payout is over this very, very long term and that's not really what we want to focus, on this point and then the other one. So because I kind of look through, there's kind of four categories, the other one is AI itself and data science. where I think Jesus that's actually what I think we have the most",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): It would take a lot of work but it would be the most valuable whereas the ability to back. Yeah, you can build pie tour scripts you can deploy science models in QA Data News, xgboost, I think I was teaching it last year, so I've got a little bit of a handle on what it would look like, but it's definitely use case that I see is underserved, ironically, in that, it seems like there's more tools for web development as an obvious thing.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Thank you.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): But at the end of the day, these data science scripts, just aren't that complicated. They're hundred line Python scripts and the AI already does a really, really good job of producing it. And the few times when I've read papers for academia, where people try to kind of do this, they're always like data science. You think it's gonna be impossible because they underestimate the power of LMS and then they do it, they're like, We thought this wouldn't work in just kind of work and we didn't have to do anything. Here's our results, Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Your Excel spreadsheet just using the LM to ask you are any of these anomalous?",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): So that's an area that I think I think so I think basically we should do this start with front end first as the niche we focus on",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): The Add in the Web development part of that first. So just, building static pages, CSS, that type of thing. Then do the Web game\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): because again, I think it doesn't involve us changing the tech stack. And, it should be kind of a fun thing to do anyway and it'll be a good easy thing. Then go to the back end and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): what solution we have there and we can spend, a bunch of time on that and then go to AI Data, Science itself and our audience is the intersection of those which is generally just developers nowadays, right. It's combination of Web developers and data scientists is that this is gigantic category and for people that are using it for every day work, I think we want that to be this, it's just gonna be such a common thing that we shouldn't totally disregard it even if it's not like our core audience, but I think the trick is just not over committing to it, but",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): The margins, we do have users using a bunch of Identifying, some use cases that are really, really super common and then I'll just call it general knowledge work, right. And then kind of going in and saying, Okay, if people are just draft, an email, and that's the number one, use case. okay, we should put in a little bit of effort, make that a little bit better simply so that people can kind of use it, but almost have that the entirely data driven where it's just like, okay, once we have the dashboard and really seeing what people are doing, just spend a little bit of time, making sure that really common cases we have some visibility into how well they work? recognizing that they're not a very good differentiator, but if people are gonna do it as a matter of evaluating, as many things, it's good to have whatever the most common cases are",
  "01 (2024-09-09 15:10 ): 05:00",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): And then the other one that's almost like the elephant, the room is marketing itself. Partially because for us marketing, it's great to have, what I mean? good stuff for doing content marketing. I do. And I know, so, what I'm gonna do is I am gonna work with this barbershop because I'm just curious how that's gonna like as a test case, I'll just be a good way to personally try with. I'm a little bit. The reason why I like the technical stuff so, is not only that we have more of a technical background, but also because you can test it, right? You can run the code and then get feedback, right? The marketing. It's sort of like,",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): If you're doing comprehensive marketing what I found with the AI is it's way too. It just kind of gives you a good overview like you would do by just reading one of these. Good blog posts of Do Omni Channel marketing here, the 50 things you should do and then do all of them. But the reality is like it doesn't really help Prioritize your individual business, very effectively for some specific type of marketing knowing kind of",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Okay.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): why I already have these assets or this is really where we're good or not but there's one area that I think we can do with marketing and that is Take our individual marketing strategy and build and make sure our AI is good at it so that we can use it internally and we might as well have that, they'll be part of the thing as\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Yeah, thanks. Very",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): And I think that looks like SEO and content marketing. I mean I think that's how we should be doing marketing.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Right.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): I don't think, I mean,",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): There can be a little bit of social media to promote content, but at the end of the day, I just, don't think it really like that Risa. they just don't have any social media. there's this other strategy which is you have very, very little content even, but your content is proven to be that state of the art in this,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): technical space, And then you're just like, all right? We called one blog post a month and it's like, we're the best at something and then you go to the well-known,\u2026",

  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): It's like Mark Tech Post, is the obvious one, but there's a bunch of other, sites and just be like, Hey, we have a state of the art thing. Add this to your, An article about this or we'll send you an article about this, and then using and linking in, with, moss, SEO to understand okay, what are the titles of, blog posts that are performing? what's kind of the thing? And then also this research of AI itself, even",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): A marketing standpoint of basically having our internal thing scanning these articles are coming out.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Being like this is what people are talking about right now and then writing content that aligns with that and then pushing that out. But I don't think that's in some ways. It's just blog writing, that's the beauty of keeping it. It's not really designing the marketing plan kind of thing. It's not pricing, it's just like, very seo, content driven. And then I think that can also be something that's a good differentiator yeah, that we can have in those example, questions, that's like write me a blog post about",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): This topic and have that work really One thing I've decided that I think we shouldn't focus on for So frankly, this proposal writing thing. I think it's just gonna be a distraction frankly, because it takes so much time talking to these people. it's such a, I don't know, government is its own beast, some people, that's what they, But to me it's just like",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): It's frustratingly slow and there's no I don't know.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): So I think whatever in a year or something or six months we have all the other things. If it's something that really is a good idea. We can always come back and do it but I'm just diving gonna think about it for the I mean indefinitely focus on these technical things focusing on us marketing this product and that And then you said, any use cases that people are actually using it for a lot? Should just be obviously, something that we put a little bit of effort into. So that's what I kind of see as we go. And",

How am I actually gonna structure some of the feedback loop of this AI itself to actually have it Really achieve some of these goals we want because the evals actually gonna write themselves the way we should do.",

  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:10 ): I mean.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): because they're in the database, And then what we can kind of do later is once we have a bunch where you kind of know Hey this one I didn't like the output for some reason. we'll just all at once in a month. just kind of go through all those will copy and paste them into files and we'll manually edit the being what we want the response to be. And then we'll have an eval with, 50 or 100 use cases, where the thing fails and then we can go ahead and turn have that be the regression test as we modify the AI, or choose different models or try to call. There's a lot of this is we need the evals so that we can try to get rid of the cost. making sure it's still works, right? Because that's",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): But at the end of the day trying to sit down and just being like Hey let's write a hundred test cases. I don't think that leads to the best test cases. I think it's better just organically. I mean do three or\u2026",

I'm like, yeah, it did a pretty good job, like sighting sources and everything but they're all a year out of date and just once we had search that'll be a great, Test case to see how that works.

  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Before then they are the father questionable that thing and how you're thinking how the follow up with him that's with the help of the image and at the fall of what we will, have some questions come from for that also,",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Yeah, I will generate it, we'll have a prompt that will be generate follow-up questions.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:10 ): but it should not get stuck in that loop. No, just ask the whole of all of that.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Yeah, So this one thing about though, even a loop that terminates if it's two or three cycles can be a lot. So what I'm kind of thinking just off the top of my head for a larger project. So the first thing is when someone asks the question, We shove a new prompt that's actually like is this a single turn question that we can just answer right away?",
  "01 (2024-09-09 15:10 ): 15:00",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:10 ): ",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Is this a question that we can answer away by doing a single search? Is this an answer that we question we can answer right away by doing a single run of the code interpreter, And if it's any of those cases, it should just do it, It's just like yep, there's not Then in the case though where it's like no this is actually a little bit larger than that it's either a relatively complex task or kind of like a project on then it's going to this mode. So one thing that is okay, the first thing it does is it asks a single set of initial follow-up questions, okay?",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Then what it does is it comes up with alcoholic, a plan, almost, like summary. I'm not getting the whole project. Yeah. But here's based on those initial responses. Here's a plan of the idea and a second set of questions and then basically Once you answer those questions, it does a draft of the project, So it doesn't everything loop but it's two sets of questions with this sort of plan in the middle that way, because I was just thinking, if you're developer and you're like, I have a client here. How do you usually have to do this? I found in the past, If you do a lot of questions, without showing them something you need to show you. It doesn't work too well. But you kind of almost like the first meeting when you're just getting the basic ideas. You usually asking, follow-up questions, like ad hoc right, at the very least ones are disembiguating confusing. I just really didn't know what you meant by that, Or",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): What do you mean by this type of thing and then you usually come with some sort of plan, right? And\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:10 ): You have.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): then you go back and you meet with a client and then it's like, Okay, here's the scope of work. Let's call it,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Yeah. Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): or something like that. And then there's usually another back and forth where you kind of have questions and then you start building stuff. And then I've done this would go the one client that was they didn't know what they wanted, and I should have been more aggressive up front of just not building anything. And then being like, nope, you've got to, Tell me what you want Instead of saying I could build stuff and I don't know, you haven't even told me a single actual page that you want, you just all these ideas and then at some point a month and a half into the project, when they're like, Why are you not getting stuff? Done. I was like, Okay, I'm gonna write down every single question that I have and then you do answer every single question and being 50 or 60 questions, two pages of questions. And we said that for two hours, I just asked every question of on this page",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Which happened here and then we just kind of built that out direct. And then I'm like, and then I'm not asking anymore follow-up questions, because I don't want them to change their mind about, it's like, Okay, these are the answers to the 50 questions. You had your chance to sign the page, we're building the page and that type of approach, I think is good. So we have them output a draft and then maybe they kind of comes back. And it's like, Okay, what do you think of this or give a basic critique or What do you want to modify? And then at some point, maybe there's a second draft. And then it's like, okay, here's",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): A zillion questions kind of a lot of questions just be very for every single detail in this entire thing. I just kind of made this decision arbitrarily but are you happy with this? Are you happy with this? but that's what I answer. Maybe we should take some time to think about so this because I had some ideas. one idea says doing more of the chat a concept of what is a unit of chat and has this relate to this project on an ongoing thing? Because one of the things I do want is if somebody at I like the idea that people can just start with chat because it's very, very understandable how to do it but then automatically right if someone's make me a website it shouldn't be. This traditional chat,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:10 ): ",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): even with these questions. One is we really need to actually store their project in some way that's referable by file names and then",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): In the future as we're outputting text we don't want them to copy and paste it. That's the important part and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Hey.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): not even sort of, in the way Cluade does a preview of just kind of being like, You have a chat here. this output we need, so that's way more persistent. So what I'm thinking is we do have some concept called project which is basically a file system and for this case, we're going to start with only front end development. So we should only allow files that work in the front images, HTML CSS, and JavaScript basically, and then",
  "01 (2024-09-09 15:10 ): 20:00",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): As they talk with the chat, it's very concretely, modifying that file system as part of what the chat does. And then it's like, Okay, we always go back to that, chat and even to the extent, even to the extreme of almost I think that project should be in version control or some form of version control. That is something that can be discuss that when you talk about the chat, undo, that change. I don't like that, right? Or even\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:10 ): The.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): if it's something that, the user can actually click in a UI and be like, we go back to that previous one. because the other idea that might be a little more challenging implement, but I think might be good is actually something where they have almost the preview that's User-facing, right? That' this is the site, but also a preview that has the site that allows them to then click on pieces to communicate back to the chat, what they're talking about, right? So they don't have to",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Their words to be meaning I'm in the same way that the inspector has that button to be like,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Name.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): look at an individual element in this way. It would be so, choose an element to then refer to in the chat so that you can feel instead of just being make the nav bar bigger, It's like okay,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:10 ): I got that.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): got thing and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:10 ): I got that point.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): it might just Yeah, yeah. And I think we're doing a simple way right\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Select element. And",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): where it actually just Yeah. Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): And even something that's like this is actually where I think the audio would be really powerful if we have the be good, which is contextualized audio where it's recording all the time. But when they click on some element and give a very specific command that audio command combined with the thing that they're actually working on forms a complete prompt, So, it would be someone clicking on a button and be like, I can't read this button fix that and it would just automatically generate a prompt. That's like, the contrast is too low of button with ID this fix that contrast and then generate a patch and then have the preview update and right and have the file system update and have that whole flow. So, a lot of this is, I mean, I think these are good ideas. The question also is, what are we actually want to implement? And what's practical? I do think we definitely need.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): the concept of it being a persistent project so that we can do the preview and people can really because that was the one thing I didn't hear back this weekend that I was unsurprised, They're the biggest problem with most of these tools that aren't like co-pilot or Gemini is just like they don't connect seamlessly to the stuff you're working on and uploading files.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Isn't like the biggest problem. That's one thing that's handy so that I have a file want to analyze you upload it but it's more the other way around that it's like the output has to be copied and pasted and in between chats. and I think that's the thing would cost that will play into that which is the current mode of being I want to keep extending the chat longer and longer and longer and then using that context gets really expensive. I think the way we really want it to almost be as like if I'm working on a project, I do want it to appear like one giant chat I just keep chatting about that project is always like him talking to the person working on the project and it's very detached from the idea of what the context actually shows. And this idea that everything previously in the chat is available from a retrieval perspective to load in but is not automatically included. And then there's really need a more sophisticated system. I think that's the way that",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): It going. And then the other part too is I think the big missing feature from these chatbots is the ability to talk about other chats and have retrieval happen on those other chats, if I say something like design me a Web page, one of the follow-up questions can be like Do you want me to start with the boilerplate we use for the last project the accounting app? I mean an extra refer to the fact we did that three days ago. I don't want to like redo that and you should know about that. how basically every chat have access to all the other chats, from a retrieval perspective, me and they don't automatically get included but",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:10 ): That will increase the cash figure And that is,\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:10 ): that is little bit of complex presentation. You should know this that has created an engaged to this topic.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Mmm.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Meaning every time the presentation website,\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:10 ): sometimes we do basic status also like that mail or do something like basic stuff other than the website building. So how that particular piece of chat, yes, avoided how that particular presentation into that particular you can send domain That's them in.",
  "01 (2024-09-09 15:10 ): 25:00",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): No. That's the beauty. As we wouldn't really do on this course, domain idea, it would be based on using rag, in the same way that whether we're probably gonna create an embedding for every chat message,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Wow.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): We have to do that. So in the same way that like we did, we'd have to do it with file uploads in the first place, right? So, if someone uploads a 10 megabyte file,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Okay.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): The way that chat GPT basically works for the file uploads is they don't do rag when you're file upwards in chat. It's actually meant to be used by the code interpreter. Meaning if I upload a 10 megabyte that doesn't actually go into the context, nor is it searchable? it can be referred to from code, that's generated and that's it. And then, if you go to the teams or the playground, and you upload files into that, upload thing, they charge 10 cents per gigabyte per month, and they turn it into an embedding.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): So, it actually generates some betting of it, and then you can do rag search, You can actually do a search being, Find the results of, Here's some question and then it'll automatically look through those files. So, Yeah,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:10 ): We got it.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): no. I mean, It is a much more technically complicated because it,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): it forces us to decide what we're gonna do about rag generally with. But what I realized is, if we're gonna resolution for retrieval, you should definitely apply that. So to the other chats the person's putting in right because that's obvious place\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Really.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): where there's 10 megabytes of generate data that's exactly the frustrating part as a user being like I just did this three days ago and right now you have to open this other chat copy and paste stuff in or",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Yeah, even the fact that you wait the artifacts and Claude kind of tries to address that but my feeling like I don't want artifacts where it's like now this thing it's a threshold, we have some idea called an artifact. I mean, I like the idea of it, It's okay. the idea of this feedback question where it doesn't automatically use previous chats because you want to have control user but it searches them probably with embedding search and then if it seems like there's something for a previous chat, that would be useful to this. Then we all question related to that chat and at the answers once you use that or why let's start with that just okay kind of keep it easy listening, all questions might even be like yes or no questions and then it's just a button two button, This although I think should be sliders. So one that I think could be good. Is basically how much do you want me to?",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Built-in knowledge from the model. How much you want me to use the instructions that you give me to override that because I noticed that I always get frustrated that how much prompt engineering goes into being like Do the thing I'm telling you rather want to do\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:10 ): No.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): but sometimes you actually want to be the whole reason I'm using this chatbot is, I don't really know the best way to do it. So I kind of want the best practices out of the chatbot and it's in your domain. The more likely you are to kind of be like, I want this to be steerable and the more you're like, No, the whole point of this is I don't know anything about marketing, but I want a blog post. So I just make it the best way. And for example, where we're doing that disclaimer, I would have said it all to being Don't do what you naturally want to do do what we're telling you because I'm very specific here.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Yeah, that thing.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:10 ): As I'm done anything. Yeah. Use it nice like it.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:10 ): How to play out then?",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Yeah. And so yeah,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): what is, we'll just take our time on this. That's the big, thank you, reminding myself as much as I'm telling you because I don't know about you, but it's so easy. Once you get in that sprint mode to then, just stay in it and be like, we got, mean all right, let's get this done by tomorrow.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Let's get this. And we'll have the thing one, if you're amazing and two weeks. But the reality is okay, we did that big sprint and it's better to think about the stuff at this point. A little bit, take a step back. Yeah. And then yes, I think the concrete next I think we don't really need to do anything.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Before Wednesday. I mean there's nothing concrete that makes sense to get done and then what I think we can do is on Wednesday. We can just work together purely on talking about the infrastructure stuff like Okay what do we want production to look like and just kind of walk through those decisions and then kind of just inventory kind of what we currently have and maybe jot down some notes on what did we do at that last stage to put it into production and then we kind of need to duplicate And kind of throughout the",
  "01 (2024-09-09 15:10 ): 30:00",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): solve the whole thing. We're just kind of work on that together, and then kind of go from there.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): I think that should be good.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Sure.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:10 ): And the cost is I did try this thing like this where get the renaming done by the Me and the main execution by the naming part about the chat but with that book, meaning and as well as the formatting,\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:10 ): what else with the mini and\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:10 ): the main execution with the bigger model, like the DVD photo and the stuff and see how the cost plays out then.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:10 ): maybe because two prawns is for that and in the six rounds like the formatting one and the response and one is for getting the title of the SO It can reduce something and",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Yeah, so the formatting and the HTML for the last two stages are formatting. So yeah, exactly. the naming can be what I was realizing though and so that's where I run kind of just dive into search because a lot what I was kind of in the back of my head, realizing that I get a mini is so much cheaper. That would probably want to finite number of these four. Oh prompts and then deciding When are we doing this five stage approach? And When are we doing not even doing that at all or doing more of a feedback based approach? And then what I really is, I think what I'm gonna focus on the short term before even making a change. Because right now, visually what I'm gonna do is just keep everything identical,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Okay.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): exactly what it is in production for the next couple weeks as we figure out more hot.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Because right now the cost isn't very high because we're not having very many users, So it was five dollars. What we're testing and there was 50 cents today after",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): I did four or five prompts.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): So it's not like it's breaking the bank and where it's more. when I was thinking about doing the evals, that's when I was like, okay, I've got to figure out but the evals I can't. I'm very specifically going to do every single evalu using mini first and then get rid of all the ones that pass then run anything that failed through regular for just a single prompt and then take anyone's that don't pass there and run them through the current system, we have because it turns out that with human Eve out, they're getting 90% on 40 anyway, So it's like you getting rid of 180 prompts all for very very cheaply and then it's like, okay, then you run 20 prompts on, for and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): and there's not for humanity for a lot of these emails because they're questioning that they can't be subjective, right? They have to be gradable by an L.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): The answers are very short which means they don't cost nearly as much. Ours is costing so much because, the day that we tested, we generated 30,000 output tokens",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Which that's costing 350 or almost four dollars worth of just output tokens but just because with a lot of these questions that were ended, Take that physics quite the, ee question would be inductor.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): You see how much more tax that it makes it a good answer for questions like that because it's not just like, the answers 2.4 Henry's. It's like, all right. Here is all of background information. Here's the detailed explanation. And then by feeding out that information, it makes the answer higher quality because all that information is in the context as it writes it. But that was probably a thousand tokens or more, for that answer. And then some of the ones where we asked, it's like right. Essays those just take a lot of output tokens because we're asking to",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Yeah, that description.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Metaphor as therefore article review, or something like that, and those were wrong. so yeah, we'll put around. But I think. Yeah, with the searches before when I was doing the testing on search, I was using for a mini and it seems great for Search results. And the challenge becomes the fact that the pages that it's searching are huge So that's the bigger but yeah I mean they could be forty thousand tokens for just some giant Wikipedia article on and so we might have to do it even in more stages which is take do an emding of the chunks of the search result then do an embedding search because the embeddings are even cheaper. The embeddings are even like a tent, the price of 40 mini.",
  "01 (2024-09-09 15:10 ): 35:00",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): And so then, you only feed in the chunks that are applicable. You run that through for a mini, to create contextualized summarization and then you do a single 40 prompt with the aggregate of so this you probably take the first five search results find, one that have the answer and the chunks that have the answer summarize those and get down to about a thousand tokens of input and then for the search back, come up with some final answer that because one thing is it really is. I don't really want to shorten the output that we're producing\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): because I actually think that for now, is the biggest differentiator, he's just really complete comprehensive answers and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Mmm.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): there's just no way around that. if you're like no we want to use the best model for that final answer. We can get rid of the formatting so I think we could have",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): But that having the price will be made up for when we add search in. So I'm estimating and that's when I. So if we can cross a 20 to 25 cents per unit of work I'll call it which I haven't really Figured out exactly how I want to present that to the user. I like the idea of it just being like it's a chat because that's easy for a user to understand when they're signing up you get three chats a day. They know\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): what a chat is. On the other hand, it undermines it. If the goal is to actually have one super long chat to build a project that we don't want to cap the chat, 10,000 tokens. The whole point is, we want to just not include the context of the previous part. But then I was thinking, we could do where it's like, you get a credit or you get some more abstract usage, But then it's more hard to understand from the user's perspective, What do I get for a credit?",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): and if we do it based on actual pricing, it's like, then we can't really like Different. someone just does a little query or something. We don't want to just be like it's exactly 25 cents worth of usage or\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:10 ): ",

The reason I like the chats per day is most users won't use up all those chats per day, And so they'll use it I know if I have 25 shots per day. I'm not gonna use those up and if I don't use them, that's fine. I'm getting my money's worth and with three chats per day, you're like That's a little bit, but that's not very much.

And so yeah, so I don't know, but I think for now there's plenty that we can do to just make it better and work on that, ad searches the obvious thing. Add visibility, get the production stuff working well and then figure out okay, then I think we can focus on this one use case of web development and really kind of Let's just make this really good and then we will see how that works with the existing chat and then Is there some? Even because I think if we could have some pricing that we're still for those two cases it'll work well in these other cases because those will look a lot like the Web development project in terms of how people use it. And so we'll just have to kind of as we go see what works and",

But anybody see something like? This is the best model in the world. It's like, okay, what's actually? Yeah, I mean, I know there's a lot of fine-tune models wanna three point one, they're all really good mostly because they're companies that had some innovation before and that fine tune on lamest, free and done a good job and then 3.1 came out like all right, let's find you on that as well. but you're seeing ones like the one that haystack one should call.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): that haystacks and eval but they got a hundred percent on it. And the big complaint was just like we need better evals because we got a hundred percent. We did our find two mono and lava 3 and now we're still getting a hundred percent and Yeah.",

  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): But that's what's so weird about it. It seems like If you just decided to overfit, you could just get a hundred percent on these. There's the finite set of a thousand questions between all these evals that you could just hard code in the solutions if you really want to cheat. But it's so weird. It seems like the game is to be point one percent better and worse on one of the five to make it look like it's not too good to be true and what I want to do is just Nope. We just got a hundred percent on all the emails. the whole point of course, we cheated. that's why you guys are stupid. Just still using these emails.",

So from the 1960s, those original mit, AI labs in Stanford ilabs, they had this news, They talk to each other. there's this AI cones which are snappy little stories Allegorians from the AI lab, but one of a neural net playing e. Where the one guys? I randomly wired the neural net. And the other guy, the professors Why did you do that? He's like, I didn't want any freaking knowledge of, and then the professors close your eyes. He's okay room suddenly. Not like you really now know nothing about the room. That's not really how the world works. we're really in the real.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): And this idea kind of being like, we're gonna act like, we don't know the answers to those questions and then build models are just slightly better each time. What are you doing here? Come with new evals and our standardized. I understand why everybody knows these five evals now and they're standard, So anyways, we're just gonna get a hundred percent on all of them, whatever it takes. Because here's the thing for the coding ones you just have to run the code and you'll basically get a hundred percent if you actually feedback the results of the eval test to the pool.",

  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:10 ): okay.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): They just have a lot of esoteric knowledge and it's like, Okay if you search the Internet for easy stuff How do you do calculate and Dr. Value, it's like textbook calculation, It's not random, from some paper, or something that's new, or something like that or some really complicate creative, reasoning problem.

  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): That's yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): That's the problem. So, fundamentally. if it doesn't have a discrete answer, you have to do human grading which is subjective, which means you really can use it the way. It's being used right now, to create this baseline to compare. So, the emails are useful when done in good faith of training, particularly smaller models, and they're getting scores of 60 or 70 percent. That's where the dynamic range of these evals actually really useful to see What can they possibly do. But once the emails start getting s in the 90% and then it's like, But why don't you just use feedback to get further rather than having the model Another way to put it is if I give you a test on eat after something multiple choice math test and then I was like You're not allowed to try out the answer in what I mean? a valuate, the expression because that's cheating, that's part of taking",

The idea that you can't check your answer and have to do it The first and even think of the idea of these models have to output one word after another correctly with no backtracking That's an insane requirement for Assault, like you, as a human don't have to like, Yeah, here's a map that Here's the engineering test start writing the answers.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Hey.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Never stop, fighting to think. And it's like, humans wouldn't do very well. so why is that the test of The models, So in our case\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Yeah.",

Yeah, you pass the eval so I was the other thing I was thinking about last week, was like, What does the future of Evals look like and how do you Maybe in some domain specific ways, create evals that allow more of the spirit, what you're doing like take our coding thing, we really would benefit from having evals for this front end.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Yeah.",

  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Right for building a website. One way that I do want to do is we should render a screenshot of the website and at least Check basic things Are there. And maybe generate like selenium script or, one of those driver scripts and then to try to use the website and here's the test. So, I mean, the beauty of software is I think we can be better. If you go to something that's not in the examples, we gave that are more like, right marketing or something like that. It's really tough to be like, Is this better marketing than that? I mean theory for, that's one of the reasons why the SEO content marketing isn't bad. You actually can be which one performed better but you really can't be testing because you can't put both versions out in the wild in an equal way, right advertising?

  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): market content, marketing, are three, primary use cases. Basically, that's exactly what we need internally in the company, And that's about it, right? And so that is instead of building out a team of 50 Web developers. Hopefully by the time we need lots of Web content. We just have this thing working better and better and we're using our own software rather than using quality or open AI by themselves down the road.

Some of those sites we've even used that site Right special. Wikipedia, its that's a useful thing to add on. And then for some of once we start doing the Web specific stuff, I think there's can be very namely Mdn, but some other ones too that are very specific. We've got prioritize those over other ones and then allow users to have some visibility into that. So I don't want to do that right away, but that's just like another",

I think behind the scenes to start with, I'm just gonna hard, have a JSON file that has certain domain simple, key value like domain, and then score, right. If it's not today is not list, is just sort of as soon to be neutral. But, if it's like, Nope, I'll give Wikipedia score and then individual scripts to search a few different sites. So the big one is archive.org to actually search papers that are coming out for ai stuff and then searching MDN and Wikipedia, and just having those three and just all right, if you ask an AI research question, we will definitely just go to the primary source and, search on everything is on archive.org for the AI papers.",

It's 10 or 15 posts a day that are mostly the summaries but still, that's manageable to kind of go through and be all right. Yeah, I keep, I mean, the last few months just haven't but",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:10 ): if that's how they come to know what this thing, I am surprised they don't use it on the basis when you saved this article I guess,",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Yeah, I mean a lot of it is because it's from some other release. I think at this point it's like they're so popular that it's a place for people are submitting press releases to right and then they're doing a quick analysis of that press release in the paper. Probably with some sort of AI tool frankly to be is this state of the art? Is this claimed to be state of the art and as long as it claims to be state of the art they then turn the summary. Yeah they then probably just do ai to generate some post and then hand edit it to make it but that being said, it's very effective because",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): just having that source of information but my guess is they just have a really broad source of information and you have bad people's manually submitting. So I bet they're maybe scraping reddit scraping there's probably scraping archive.org itself but also scraping social media and yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): But sometimes you can tell that it's coming from press releases because Meta will release a bunch of stuff and then they'll have five of the six articles that day are all. They're basically written by meta. Okay, they send you this recipe but it's fine better release a bunch of important stuff. So it's not the worst thing in the world to have this yeah.",
  "02 (2024-09-09 15:10 ): 05:00",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Emotions as I met for my ideas, particularly that he said because I'm taking all and they write this dog post. I see some mostly",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Yeah, yeah, exactly.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): yeah, the biggest thing is, though, kind of, d academic, to me make it a little bit more accessible than maybe the raw paper, and definitely a lot of it to me, there's kind of boiler, play it, like, Language Models of Games, just kind of like getting you up to speed on the basic idea.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Okay.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): It compare.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:10 ): We turn your daily.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Then.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Yeah, the odd one.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): So now I'm just trying out a perplexity and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Yeah, I remember they had the demo video on our show.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): some of the prompts I tried on ours the other day.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:10 ): And the marketing thing.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Many people who are showing that. Then that particular browser,",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): ",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Man, that's not very good.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:10 ): ",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): I asked How many housing units are there in the US. It's like, I was able to find that information.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:10 ): okay.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): whereas ours comes up with this very",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:10 ): they don't know that. Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): 142.2 million. As of the census in 2020.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): actually show you this one because I think is one of the best different",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Yeah. one of the better ones that I came up with that, I'm curious to try it on a bunch of different sites and see how it, is different. But How many housing units are in the US and then it gave an answer. Even if it's from 2020 with various specific details, Of the source. and even instructions and if you want the up-to-date one, but then as follow questions, how many total bedrooms are there in the US, this is where it just is so much better than any of the other stuff it Really excites the source even though it's not recent, it's still \u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): citing down and describing all these, details and then doing this calculation of housing units.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): And then break down the category and then particulation. And the size conclusion. With sources. there's actually really nice response and then what US Metro areas have oversupply of housing? the fact that it just provides this background of here's how we're gonna find over supply.",
  "02 (2024-09-09 15:10 ): 10:00",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Yeah. Absolutely.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Here's the data sources. Here's the answer, in the US and then here's the factors specific to those cities. and then the references again with links, that's probably",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): A link color. But anyway,",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): But yeah, so that was when I was just really impressed, it formatted it perfectly. They're just like, it's a really good answer, Mrs. Yeah, this is one. I was like, okay, it had trouble with because it wasn't enough markdown. I think for it to recognize that it actually should have been converted to HTML or something. I was surprised, this didn't. General HTML correctly.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): But yeah, that's what I was kind of like, yeah, where should I go to promote it right? It's like this were my offices. I was like, all right. Go Go here.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): and then when I was talking to some bartender, he was like, yeah, this is the first week that I'm like,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:10 ): ",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): August is a dead season for the restaurants and downtown personally because Congress is out of session. But yeah, that's the biggest one. So Congress just went back into session today or this week. So that's I change in and the thing is in the spring is all the kids tourist season. So school kids fifth graders strangers from all over the country, come to DC during the spring to see the Constitution,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:10 ): The beginning.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): And the Washington, all these civic thanks it's all in the spring. It's like crazy drink spring break. It's just this insane thing. But then in a weird way people come for vacation summer by August. It's kind of like",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Not that popular. So here it really misses that there's tourist seasons and there's sure the holidays are kind of busy and obviously it's super busy. People rent out their houses for inauguration\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:10 ): ",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): because an airbnb, you get tons of money.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): But yeah, but it kind of misses this bigger. It kind of says it here late summer to early fall, but it doesn't specifically be the date is September 9th. that's what it comes back. it's very because of Congress. It's actually really specific. but anyway,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:10 ): And yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): it's still a pretty good answer for these questions and the barbershop one. Yeah. This is where I was like if it's pretty good, but it's not that actionable and it is true. this really hits the nail on the hat of this, exactly who comes into the barbershop downtown it's government employees. Local people, mostly young professionals, Middle High, and come back and busier. But yeah, that's okay, that's exactly. Yeah. I, Yeah. Pretty much true.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): But then it makes up these such specific increase foot traffic by 20%. It that's a good objective. I got, it's reasonable to just make it to have some goal. Establish an online presence, improve customer loyalty. Yeah. That's fine. and then at the end of the day, What are we gonna actually do? It's just do everything. But the point is but this is a barber shop with two barbers, they know, they should do all these things. That's not really, they don't have the time, they got to figure out what if they're already sitting on Instagram all day.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Then that's fine. I mean, I think that the better idea, they actually have influencers that come in like they need to, there's more aggressively be like, hey put our, you\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): keep posting about us, but paid ads, like a barber shop, cannot afford to pay for ads, that's just not the margin, it's like they make money every time they actually cut somebody's hair, right? it would destroy their margins to be running all these ads. this is not like some Hollywood hair salon, right? That can market, they need to get the people that are in the offices and they're the building next door to realize that there's a barbershop, what? They actually did last week. This is working, as well as they put one of those blow up inflatable, tube. you don't know the things I'm talking about, they're Air flows through a tube and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:10 ): this juggling. Okay.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): they flop around they're car dealerships. Yeah.",
  "02 (2024-09-09 15:10 ): 15:00",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): And so they put one of those up and it's like because the problem is they're doing construction on the building. So there's scaffolding in front of all their windows. you really can't tell there's a barber shop in there and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Then whatever.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): so yeah, so they put this thing out front and say yeah people like coming by and staring at it and so I don't know, it's not bad advice, but then it's like, if you took this, it was good brainstorming and it's good to be like, we should do that. But a lot of it, I know it's give discounted rates. It's like once you start giving discounts",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Again, it's a barber shop with you are already charging what you need to pay the rent on that, You really don't want to discount it and get people to think and hopefully you want people to come in and just hey the same price every time and keep getting a haircut there forever. And in reality, they're bigger problem is they don't have a good scheduling system. so my guess is a lot of people after they come there the second or third time or just I call the guy and he says, he can cut my hair right away, and then I show up and there's four people in line in front of me. It takes two or\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:10 ): That I was away.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): three out.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:10 ): That problem is that I thought that will they have for them? people can schedule what is The Plan are cutting timing, actually",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Yeah, this is the funny part. Yeah, so this is the whole thing. He actually has a really good website and you can schedule a haircut on it and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): it's right above the fold. So, when I got my haircut, they're the first time I was taking the Metro and I worked on Google Maps. I have a good presence on Google Maps. I clicked on the link right above the folders buttons like book an appointment. I booked an appointment.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): I showed up when he wasn't there, the problem,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:10 ): ",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): isn't it? So this is the problem with a lot of technology solutions. if he doesn't really want to use them because he doesn't like being at the other day,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): he just can't do time management. So here's his real strategy, that's actually recurring customer uses the booking app because they know it doesn't mean anything. So then books, a thing it appears like everything is open. Most people call them on the phone, just to make sure he's in the shop. And then he always says, Yeah, come right now, I can get your hair every time, no matter\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:10 ): .",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): many people in line and then, yeah, ever one some 80 year old guy was just really annoyed at him and he didn't have anything to say. He just was kind of quiet. He's like, I cut your hair and then if you will get annoyed, he'll kind of ask the other people if they can kind of go first. And it's totally a mess with the funny part is it actually works pretty well.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): How does it means that he's never empty people are waiting to get their haircut and so it's like during the busy days he's just cutting hair back to back and then people are hanging out in the barbershop which then creates us community. And you're like, if you enjoy hanging out in the barbershop for two hours to talk to people, Which in a way especially after the pandemic, that's actually like a thing that people might want to do hang out there and okay, this is kind of fine. But I have decided now that if I don't have three hours I can't go to the barber. it just okay and the rivers I can go somewhere else but",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): not like it is actually nice. I was searching for me to do networking and marketing and stuff to be like, okay, there's always four or five people sitting around. And so I'll just hang out there, talk about AI handout business cards and over the last six months, they're probably handed out 50 or 60 business cards at the barbershop, but I just have to imagine that people that are the reason why he's not getting the warriors from K Street, He's right in the heart of the famous lobbying area for DC, but they can't hang out for two or three hours to get there haircut. And so, there's one lawyer that comes in and always kind of jumps the line and gets his haircut and 10 minutes and leaves and He was in the other day and I was just like, that your thing is, a mess here. but it's hard to fix, Because, yeah, if you totally changed it to everybody has to get an appointment.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Then he'd have when people don't show up you\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:10 ): I think at least have one person\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): he's missing that time. So we probably get better officiency.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:10 ): who is free available whenever the appointment is there and he has two or three inside that cutting the hands two or three people are getting that.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Yeah, I mean that the other part of it, they're three barbers, but that's the trick, he's gonna make more money, the more hair, he cuts personally,\u2026",
  "02 (2024-09-09 15:10 ): 20:00",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Yeah, and",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): so you could be like, No, I want the other guy. I want this particular guy but",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Orders back. you're busy. you're right. So they usually do that, If he's really, really busy with people and then he'll try, I'll have this other guy cut hair but the other part that he does is when you go to the website, he and his wife cut hair and there's two other barbers, you can really only schedule appointments for he and his wife, you really not well set up for the shop as a whole for the other barbers to do well, in my opinion, because it makes sense that someone comes out this, if they just find it online, they're automatically getting an appointment with him and then it's So he's kind of constantly cutting hair even though frankly, one of these other barbers is kind of a better bar, he's really really good haircuts, this guy's good, but he's not exceptionally good. And then there's a third barber\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:10 ): yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): who just doesn't have as much business and does a pretty good job, but he was at the other shop for, I was working on the basement for a while. That doesn't part of the reason I go, when I showed up, I was like, is it gonna get this office in the basement of the other barbershop",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Working there for the first month back in March and then now they closed that entirely. And so the other barber kind of moved over to the shop. so the it's not like a marketing. I don't really think is their problem. Exactly. Because it turns out that\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:10 ): All right.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): if you're a barbershop downtown just being on Google Maps, having a good website so that would be a big thing. It's like, if they didn't have a good website,",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): You'd like, we could have ad bill. This one for the problem though is they don't operationally want to like and this is a lot of clubs is right? They don't want to change in business, last 20, or 25 years and it works, And so it's hard to actually know, if you change all those things, would it be better or worse? And they have their system, it works, but it makes it hard to improve at the margin or take advantage of sort of I don't know this advice other than a few things of being like go to local other businesses and tell them about you. I've got this barbershop over here so they can recommend you but from the way he talks with everybody, I bet he's already doing that.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): But here I'll give you the link just to show you the also meet with him and just show him Okay, we had our put some stuff out and whoops, But I don't really think there's that much other than meet for an hour talked about General Marketing and then I kind of want to ask them. Do you follow the appointment schedule? Because if you don't follow the appointments, Yeah, that seems like you're gonna have a hard time to",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): So, their websites good, I mean it's not reflective of the actual barber shop, but that doesn't really matter",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Yeah, the fact is they make an appointment, it's a nice looking. And for a barbershop that's probably the most important thing And it has the hours and the location. And",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): and they do have, a certain amount of haircuts and videos of",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): To kind of show, again, is what we do. But yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Products over there.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Yeah, he does. So a lot of stuff too, like glasses and shoes, and jackets and cologne and I don't know how she actually sells but",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): But weird with it. The thing actually works out fine, they don't have bad marketing, the business kind of works, but",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:10 ): when they don't want to maintain that, then why they have capital reps and everything, I like",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Why they kept the website? Then when they don't know,\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): what do you mean, why keep\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:10 ): I like when they don't",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): because it's effective because I mean, At the end of the day, people come and this is a nice looking, thing and I sign up for an appointment, right? The reality is \u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Yeah, and they",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): it's important for that first time customer two, set an appointment, and then they show up then they get their haircut and they're like, I like this place and they come back, if they kind of acknowledge the fact that, they, kind of don't really have an appointment system, it would be frustrating to people. I don't even know how to say. It's this weird. always trying to make it seem like Yeah, we have appointments, it's only until the third or\u2026",
  "02 (2024-09-09 15:10 ): 25:00",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): fourth time, you go that you always know there's no system here. There's just cutting people's hair and sort of shuffling everybody around all day to kind of make the thing work.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): But it works I mean at the end of the day they get lots of people and they kind of always cutting hair during the prime, time and everything.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:10 ): No, yeah, the same thing. I feel that will happen. If I give them the booking app and all the story people not follow on there, maybe.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:10 ): when there are lots of customers and everybody wants their haircut,",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-09 15:10 ): Moving. Okay.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): And it does I mean the next version it puts soft pressure in that let's say you show up at four o'clock and you're like why scheduled at 4 o'clock appointment? And there's three people in line in front of you. Yeah, he might be like, okay, you do a four o'clock appointment and then put you ahead of the walk-ins, right? Because it's like, okay, you're still gonna have to wait 15 or 20 minutes But it's also, if you don't say that you had an appointment, he's not working, He's not like, yeah, I've got that. Four o'clock appointment.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-09 15:10 ): kind of thing. yeah. so it'll be interesting just to kind of show him hey our ai generated some",

  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 14:21 ): We looked so yeah. I mean I was just thinking about more like, What is our goal here? And what's the big idea? Because I realize in the last, we released the MVP that was good because it gave us something concrete to kind of be, our build something. In a month, we saw this chat tool but now it seems Were both putting our heads down trying to iterate on this thing without really. I deciding what are we building? It is this of any value, right? Before we go any further on this rabbit hole,",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 14:21 ): What is this? Look like if we just keep doing this right, I think the answer is It's just both of us spending most of our time working on a web application that is layered on top of other people's AI.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 14:21 ): ",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 14:21 ): Which is not bad for doing for taking, I mean, I'm glad we did it because taking a month to say,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 14:21 ): .",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 14:21 ): Okay, we built something and it's only really took, a month or two. what I\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 14:21 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 14:21 ): Yeah, this is what this looks like, really the shop location. But as I was going, work on a little bit. But then I catch a step back and kind of thought, especially, part of it was even just this. all right, if we're modifying the AI,",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 14:21 ): And if we're doing the AI sort of, just part of this chat thing rather than sort of like the chat as something to demonstrate the AI. Then so I kind of came to the conclusion. I think we really need to rethink what's the long-term goal? and basically What are we trying to spend our time doing? And basically, I thought about that. I really can't inclusion that I think the chat is at the end of the day just like a really big distraction. If we want to have chat we need to build the chat, right? That's maybe the value we got of is we did\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 14:21 ): Mmm.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 14:21 ): You built this ai and now you kind of build this chat tool. And now you kind of seeing okay, one",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 14:21 ): This is what it looks like using a human developer. That's experienced with an AI in the loop and the answer my kind of big takeaway. Yeah. So let's start by talking about the chat tool and just what we learn from it because I think at the end of the day I'm lean through that at least temporarily. We just Leave the chat to exactly like it is basically because it's this thing on the website. I think it also demonstrates. to people that I talked to or, going into this talk in a couple weeks that at the end of the day,",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 14:21 ): Hey.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 14:21 ): we're not just some company, that's all talk. Yeah, we were able to build it a chat thing in a month. it is what it is, which is chat is more of building some application. And we could even say, ransom evals and we did about the same, we got, 2% higher on mlu. So we'll start by talking about chat and I just want to talk about",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 14:21 ): The big picture of AI. And what, we think about We make sure I turned on the neutron of the transcript.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 14:21 ): Yeah. Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 14:21 ): Okay, good. Yeah. yeah, so with the chat, my takeaway from the chat is basically One, the AI in the you had an idea, ahead of time really how to build the thing. And then you were also using quad, It seemed like a lot and then also chat GPT to kind of help. My first takeaway is I don't necessarily know if the chat actually saved you time at the end of the day, I think it was out there and this is show This also gets to the deeper idea of AI, but there's this moment early on in the process.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 14:21 ): It's doing the generation part where things haven't really had to come together yet where it seems like it's saving us enormous amount of time, right? Because yeah,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 14:21 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 14:26 ): because my gosh, look at all these files are great. Look at all this stuff and look at how it seems to all fit together, But I think it has two effects one. and I noticed this with August when he was doing the CFR search thing it inherently leads to a lot of structure because it's gonna output something that's not necessarily related to the larger context of the project. And then you're gonna look at that and say, Okay, that actually pretty good or it's really bad. It's actually easy to kind of say, that's like that does not gonna work. That's the wrong idea. But when it's like,",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 14:26 ): Pretty good, it's actually like, wow. We combine these three or four ideas, it got this code looks pretty good. that's how frankly. Almost gonna be like, Wow, that's almost a little bit better than I would have written. Now, I don't really think I think that's the trick, right? I think it actually,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 14:26 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 14:26 ): it looks better than what you think you would have written, especially given the fact that it's only a minute pass. And so you haven't had the time to do the normal, cognitive process of kind the theory of the program, right comes down to that idea that theory of the program.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 14:26 ): ",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 14:26 ): And so, I think my big takeaway is that",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 14:26 ): You end up with this program that you have to add it's always gonna output, some baseline assumptions about the rest of the system and then it's actually very easy. Once it does that a few times their self-consistent to sort of implicitly shoes that structure as sort of the architecture and get this illusion of architecture. it's a deep illusion, because even when I read the code, Wow, at first, I was like that. Just seems like a lot of code for the size of the project we're trying to build, but then when I look deeper, I'm like, if all this works, it's a good forward facing abstraction. But when the rubber hits the road, the way that I knew in the end of the day, like what I thought about last week that at the end of the day, it's actually mostly kind of noise and it's not solving the architectural problems is now that we're iterating on it.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 14:26 ): It's not actually an effective architecture of iterate on the way you can tell that there's tight coupling, Is the fact that for any change. So we're trying to make to the system, almost any idea you're making a change through the entire application, everything from the schema to the user interface to the back end,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 14:26 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 14:26 ): There's nothing. Yeah, and it's sort of And the reason isn't that, it's not even like with the architecture is Because they're sort of Theo reticle levels of indirection, it's simply that",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 14:26 ): By having the AI kind of output these first order kind of decisions and then having them seem pretty reasonable, it was like The architecture of the Core Data structure was really raw. And then when you go to change that, your whole application is not particularly sound, right? So let me take a step back and that's not even in the Clean Architecture. Book doesn't usually it kind of refers to this as these entities, right to be like these are the core ideas but it makes this assumption because it was really designing the 1980s and 90s there's already this existing business out there that sort of knows, what it does all the time and therefore actually has a reasonably good idea of kind of these core piece of information that the business deals with that might be on paper.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 14:26 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 14:26 ): They might be what people talk about. And then at the end of the day you're automating that,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 14:26 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 14:26 ): if you're building an accounting system,",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 14:26 ): It's like an account that is a unit of thing, an entry you have it. It's any other textbooks for accounting county modern accounting goes 500 years. Really basically unchanged with double entry bookkeeping. that's what accounting is. That's three ideas and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 14:26 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 14:26 ): then you build abstraction on those three ideas and those ideas really predated computers. And so when you're like,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 14:26 ): All right.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 14:26 ): doing accounting or if you're saying, I'm gonna build a social media site or something, you think? Yeah, we've connections between people and then they communicate with each other. always Everything else is a detail. How exactly the communicate, right? And here when it's like, what is ai and then why is a chatbot sort of the default way? You interact with it? If we really thought about it up front rather than just sort of saying, We're duplicating the functionality of this, what I mean? I'm chat gpt as I can use your interface and then kind of just, chatting with the quad or whatever to be like, okay?",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 14:26 ): This thing we would have really probably thought it through more and talked about it. And come up with this idea that at the end of the day, when you actually get below, the surface AI is a prompts and then the AI's response to those props and we would have probably started with this idea, And then I think we would have gone further and this is something that I kind of thought of early on but why are we using a database or\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 14:26 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 14:26 ): relational database in the first base? We actually have any relational data.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 14:26 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 14:31 ): And the answer it's about this non-relational as a data, start thinking. Yeah. And therefore the choice of postgres. if you notice did you even write a single join in the whole mean maybe there's one in there but probably I doubt it. I mean mostly it's like look up the thing directly in which case one even if we said we wanted a database mango might have been a better choice but additionally I'm still being towards this idea that I think back on it the reality of the scope of, if the goal is to say Okay actually the AI I give you this directive and so you did a great job. I don't want to make that really get a month. I wouldn't said, Hey, I want you to shift gears from doing security. to raise your saying, let's build a chat box. So we have something that's concrete, which is good and the reality and you said, Okay, I'm gonna build a child, you did, right? So that's like, I mean,",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 14:31 ): Very impressed that we got something in a production, you're on the basement, build the whole thing. and the AI wasn't really like the other thing I realized at the end of the day, we weren't really using AI to build the tool like you were doing most of the work and then I was more acting as it's like, senior engineer doing kind of reviewing the idea to giving insight into how I wanted. It part client part, Code Review or not even code review too. A little bit of code review more like, and the other day even then I was mostly focused on. All right, is this wild application? Good and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 14:31 ): yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 14:31 ): is the AI even this idea of reading a traditional startup from 10 years ago, where it's like, which we're like when I was in the Bay Area and I knew all these people doing startups and I was doing my own stuff. It was always like, you got to build an MVP, you got to get users. You've got",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 14:31 ): To get attraction, really really early. Because at the end of the day,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 14:31 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 14:31 ): the technology is not a differentiator, It's just something you need to build as quickly as you can until you get the founders of the successful companies, we're all technical and they don't get involved in building application because the application was the thing. And the end of the day,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 14:31 ): ",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 14:31 ): the whole idea of an MVP is like, you don't want to build the wrong application. So just build something you can get customers to tell you,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 14:31 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 14:31 ): users to tell you what they really want. And then keep building that and iterate really quickly. so my takeaways yeah, the whole thing was good because it was good like learning experience and it gave us something concrete. I want to keep it up. Basically just as is and maybe we can do, maybe it's worth.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 14:31 ): It will talk about this later, Maybe it's worth kind of finishing up. The work you already have. We can get just one more version in the production that we can kind of just sit out there and we don't really touch. and I did an iteration on the AI so that I haven't really tested it. I figured whatever. it's the biggest ones that are placed GPG, 40 with GPT Mini on almost all the",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 14:31 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 14:31 ): Almost all the prompts and then I really went back and we wrote the HTML one so that hopefully it actually like outputs python and c and everything. We can iterate that a little bit, but at least that way it's okay. We have a few known things and then hopefully, really get cheaper. That was my other kind of thought I'd say we're gonna keep it on the website and not really promote it too much and just have it be a way of demonstrating. They're like, Okay we're where this AI company and we have in one of the things we did is we really just chatbot and basically we can exactly say just not really different from chat gpt or quad, if you want to use it go ahead and it is what it is. And if I won't get much users, who won't have to worry about the cost therefore just kind of sit there, it's easy to kind of explain. And then later, I think, what we really want to do with it is then say, okay.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 14:31 ): How would we have an AI build, something like that, You know what I mean? really and kind of look back. But I did a lot of steps in between, that.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 14:31 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 14:31 ): So let's take a step back. Now I really thought through the business as a whole this and this gets to the start of this thing which is if we treat it like a startup and follow the wings startup kind of playbook, I think we're going down the entire wrong path. And I've been kind of focused on in the last couple months\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 14:31 ): Hey.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 14:31 ): because it's very straightforward in a way, which is like I just said, you're always nothing being right on it, you get feedback from the users. You try not to spend money on stuff like research and development.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 14:31 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 14:31 ): And whether or not you say okay we're the SAS bootstrap company or whether you're funded either way you're really looking at it as well for sat for bootstrap,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 14:31 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 14:36 ): we need to more aggressively get more larger customers and then actually have them pay then deliver on that and kind of grow from there. And if you're funded, then the other day, it's like, you get a zillion users are actually using the product. but here the shot, the problem with that approach. And then you need, this idea of what you go to market strategy, it's got to be something that's very very straightforward marketable. do beating the emails like that's a very straightforward go to marketing strategy but hey it doesn't matter what the thing does. Because the end of the day, if you beat the emails you get a bunch of press people use a product that you work from, But here's what I'm realizing that's not what the moment we're in, It's not what building an egg companies really about, is the fact that AI doesn't work that well right now.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 14:36 ): I mean, as a reality of the situation, it's all these use cases that can be kind of useful. If you deeply have a human in the loop and then they develop experience, using the chatbot and then say, Okay, this saves me a little bit of time, But it's the whole reason why AI is so exciting. why it's gonna change? Everything is that it truly does something, fundamentally different? There's current iteration. I think that's not just a superficial thing. some marginal advance is not gonna suddenly unlock this idea. And really what it comes down to is these are statistical models that are fundamentally disconnected from sort of truth or first principles right making the marginally better at a wide. Variety of use cases doesn't actually do anything for that problem and fundamentally I think that the people for example people open AI",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 14:36 ): there and people certain areas of Google that are doing the transformer, Google stuff, our men do what anthropic music, they're missing this idea that",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 14:36 ): If you view it as this low gain statistical model, where you're simply trying to find the mean output, you aren't recognizing the fact that truth when you actually can confirm it through some first principles approach allows you to actually build high gain feedback mechanisms and those gain feedback mechanisms, allow you to build complex structure that this grounded in truth. Even as you get multiple steps away from those first principles, right? Because you see that sort of the challenge,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 14:36 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 14:36 ): If I put in some first principle idea, we need to be very secure and here's the other top 10 and here's a really hard and fast rule that no one external should be able to snoop on my network. And then we say, and I want to prove that that's actually true.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 14:36 ): You can't suddenly then step up from that statement up to sort of proving that's actually the case but just using more and more prompts with the large language model, it's not suddenly getting more connected to the truth or internalizing what you're saying better. It's also so terribly inefficient my biggest takeaway actually, so we think about just What are we learn from doing this chat thing? My biggest takeaway is that The costs are insanely high. I mean, I know I knew that going in but it would still like and then I've been reading a lot about open ad because right, they're raising money and they had I don't know if you, read the last few days about all the open AI stuff,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 14:36 ): There are wonderful.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 14:36 ): but Yeah, I try to get 150 billion,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 14:36 ): When he died,\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 14:36 ): their CT. Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 14:36 ): he took itself, the 5% of the company, I guess.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 14:36 ): But doesn't matter. I mean that's all know\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 14:36 ): ",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 14:36 ): Sam who cares, I mean you just some guy who's an investor basically he's a glorified investor He ran why commentator he's not an AI guru to be clear.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 14:36 ): It. Yeah, yeah God because he told now he will go into text with Larry was in there. Not big area that Early was saying that.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 14:36 ): He's not even like a leader of a tech company historically he's really looking invested in a thousand things he's not even a good investor practically anyway.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 14:36 ): Hmmm.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 14:36 ): Who cares about Sam Alvin say?",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 14:36 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 14:36 ): Almonds are talking hat murali though? she left, She's the CTO and with her a bunch of and research people left. That's what meaningful open. AI is bleeding Real important people, Okay.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 14:36 ): And yeah, that another thinking there, they are into what is the number one player in this field, you can say and the company which is releasing the new model and people have high hopes on their AI system and all and they are suddenly leaving the company in between and\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 14:36 ): Yeah. Yeah. Exactly.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 14:36 ): that two, three key people the chief, yes, ambition all like, who is that? Many of the building ahead taking to this that I",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 14:41 ): Yeah, and so Yeah and so the other one, no I forget his last name but he just got rehired at Google. He was one of the early opening people. He was one of the coauthors of the transformer paper that came out in 2017, right before Openai. And I think you worked to open AI or maybe worked at Google but he got fired from very left. Google he was like they're not innovating then he got rehired at Google for 2.7 million dollars salary, right? So Yeah,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 14:41 ): Yeah, yeah, that guy I remember his story was that people\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 14:41 ): but Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 14:41 ): who were rehired him but huge cost.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 14:41 ): Yeah, so you're seeing this turn, but here's the big, takeaway If you gotta read the transformer paper, and that's something we're gonna talk\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 14:41 ): Mmm.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 14:41 ): True that, going forward, I want us both to be just focused entirely on AI. And what one of the big things I really kind of want to do, is spend these meetings, really just talking about AI and then having, just be reading about AI and then I can be teaching you about both AI and semiconductors this year, yeah, I have a pretty clear vision now. So here's I'll just present it right now. We can talk a lot more about AI over the next, two weeks. Here's the basic idea that I think. So, first of all, I realize that at the end of the day, we're in the deep R&D phase of AI, This is the beginning of AI. And of this true AI and the thing that we have now with the transformer architecture, is the, turning point in turn, but it's not ai, right? There's no intelligence in the transfer, our future, and the transformer architecture,",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 14:41 ): Is a very brute force approach It assumes that you're gonna want to solve every problem simultaneously. You don't actually care if you know how to solve it. You just need to get 80% and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 14:41 ): yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 14:41 ): everything. And that's not very good. it's just it.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 14:41 ): ",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 14:41 ): So inefficient that fundamentally all it does. Is prove that it's like, finding gold or something. It's like, panning for gold. And it's like, all right, we found a couple little, nuggets of goals here. That's all it,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 14:41 ): Yeah. Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 14:41 ): I mean,",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 14:41 ): And so with that in mind and this idea of saying, Okay we're at the beginning of this RDP, is I realized that if we basically try to say we're just gonna release some product, we're gonna charge for it. We're gonna do that. I mean, I think it's totally the wrong focus and we're never gonna actually be able to be deep innovative. I think at the end of the day, we need to be an AI research company because that's only thing that makes sense, given the fact that that's the whole point is to actually be in five years the company that actually has to defensive position within the real Whatever actually at that looking so I think that's the key thing. No, with that in mind, I think the only way to do that is to raise money and so I'm basically shifting. I mean, I think again, I've always thought with a lot of these startups, particularly my experience in the Bay Area, with people that would raise a lot of money like Thumbtacking. There is a hundred million dollars, right?",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 14:41 ): Website and 12 employees like four developers. And you're okay, why? And I mean, they made this record, we're buying at the network right at the end of the day ever. I still don't think they're profitable a decade later. right in front of that, always came from this idea that if you were just building Web application stuff,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 14:41 ): Sorry.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 14:41 ): Does it really make sense to Really large amounts of money? Get on the treadmill, so that you require lots of company and then try to get bigger and bigger and bigger. And the reality was, there was never really the SAS era. For most companies never really had sound fundamentals that actually allowed a lot of these companies. They even seem like really big success stories either never became profitable or became profitable at a much lower valuation than what certain investors got it. And so the end of the day they had to",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 14:41 ): I mean, it's just not a lot of con artist but at some point someone just saying I'm gonna put my head in the sand as the CEO. Not, we're trying to figure out what we should be valued at and just sell out of the company, kind of knowing the back of their mind that we're gonna take an and I remember when I was in, Klamath Falls as a guy from LA and he's partners up in Oregon that we were working for that doing, just consulting building website for but they were eating but one day. I just remember, really He told me the pitch and the value and all this stuff and I was like, that just doesn't end up. And I made this chart and then you and I was you're your exits and none of these actually match reality. You're doing this totally wrong and then he's like, we will probably gonna exit a much lower value than those anxious. I'm like Yes. So you're basically lying directly to the investors, even when you're raising your first eat around, you're going through it. Knowing that of course we're not gonna do a 30.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 14:41 ): Hey.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 14:46 ): Million dollars we're gonna be worth 10 million dollars but I need to raise 20 million dollars to become more 10 million dollars. So that's what I'm gonna do and it's like, okay, but that even if you're successful it's gonna be miserable. so that's a side to kind of say that the venture capital ecosystem. Is frankly not very well designed for actually funding basic R&D or good deep tech, right? They're built on this idea. There's success is all come from these ultra high hurdle rate kind of things. And so at the end of the day, it's part of the reason why even though it seems like there's this really big venture investment in AI. It's a little bit of an illusion, one, given the idea that the",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 14:46 ): Art takeover, everything we're only about 70 or\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 14:46 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 14:46 ): 100 billion dollars in investment, that's point, one percent of global GDP and that's 90% of all those venture dollars are in those numbers. And so it turns out like the venture capital ecosystem is just not well structured because they're getting money from what real venture capitalists are getting money.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 14:46 ): From limited partners that really expect there to be exits within a short number of, a few years basically, And those eggs and so what, I've gone to some of these events and you're like, we raised 500, million dollars to do cryptography. How did you get them from Of course, visions would never give us that money that's not what they do. And so you know that You basically, Okay, there's also private equity, There's sovereign wealth funds, There's family offices, right? Those are to be those big categories of where you can raise money. I think another strategic venture capital. So if you see, even the open AI around, they're trying to raise. So I think Take away from the open air and is one, right? They're trying to raise not that much more money than they got from Microsoft.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 14:46 ): And that also the other bigger, takeaway was the details that actually came out through them, trying to raise money. One, was that the 10 billion dollar Microsoft deal almost entirely went back to Microsoft directly as revenue for cloud services. For you open, it has not really build up any sort of compute capacity. They just directly Microsoft said Here's 10 million dollars.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 14:46 ): What?",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 14:46 ): We're not even gonna write, you we're not gonna give you 10 billion dollars, we're gonna give you. I'm billion dollars of credits on Azure actively,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 14:46 ): God.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 14:46 ): And then it's like, and you're gonna spend those the other big takeaway is, they're Deeply, not just I'm profitable but have negative cash flows like crazy. Basically the other way, the one who don't have 10 million paying customers. They only have three hundred million in revenue per month, which basically means that they only have. But two thirds of their money comes from these,",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 14:46 ): ",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 14:46 ): twenty dollar a month, users only",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 14:46 ): About 30, something percent of the money actually comes from API uses. So, for all these third companies that are building, all these AI startups of SUNY, powered by chat GPT, none of them are being used that much, not enough to generate the types of revenue. if you look into a Google with their advertising network or Facebook with its advertising network, generally speaking, we're talking about a hundred times that, each one of those networks is bringing in Revenue, open. It's not suddenly, everyone is using some tool to behind the scenes is using chat GPT, That's just not only a lot of startups that have raised a lot of certain amount of money to and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 14:46 ): ",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 14:46 ): basically,",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 14:46 ): What the really spending money on is training and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 14:46 ): yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 14:46 ): fine-tuning models that frankly. Again, I think is totally misguided how those smaller companies are gonna burn through millions of dollars on training budgets. With something that not only is going to be obsolete, We talked about that before, but I think more fundamentally since it's not connected to ground truth or the psychi game feedback, it's just mediocre Okay again that's my big takeaway when we got the chat working and then we use it and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 14:46 ): Good.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 14:46 ): the first day was Wow, this is really incredible because it's almost like magic. I type in through works, I know that underneath. Yeah, I use a chance. You but still, it that's pretty impressive. And then after a few days it was like, Yeah, but",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 14:51 ): What really is this actually that useful? For I'm not here using? I mean, I don't really use chat to your quad very much and then what our tool I wasn't using that very much either. this is what it is. And so why these companies are fine tuning or at the margins, if they're really focused on R&D. And then just a bunch of venture capital dollars. I don't know what they're pitching as to how they're ever going to make significant amount of money. Right.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 14:51 ): so that gets us other idea, which is What is the patch If you visit these are gonna need money because one is you to make this assumption that in 10 years, AI is going to be doing everything, it's not just gonna be chatbots, right? It's gonna be no, you're automating everything and you don't need a lot of these rules and this whole idea of saying, we need you in the loop. no, if you need a human in the loop, you're missing. It's never gonna be that valuable the way you get the human out of the loop is again, you connect to first principles and you say, How do we align with what humans want when humans don't care about how it's done. Exactly. And these are solve problems or we're, whatever the problem is, we actually know there's some person out there that knows how to do it. Why can't we capture that knowledge and simply do that thing? And I remember I was thinking when I was doing a lot of meetups three or four week back in the spring. What was I telling people what was I excited about what was differentiating and then kind of going back to that I think.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 14:51 ): That's where the way I look at. It is in a long-term, you need to develop a patent portfolio, that's defensible. So that you actually have done research, you have gotten patents. And without having you don't worry about marketing or sales, if some other company wants to use what you have created, they have to do patent research and they find out, there's this company out there that's great. A thicket of patents in some field. again and this is where the semiconductor stuff comes in. It's like at the end of the day, building AI Chips is the only profitable business.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 14:51 ): And we,",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 14:51 ): I think that you're gonna see in AI and then you already see it playing out Who's the company that's making all the money from AI, it's envy. Everybody else is losing billions of dollars or\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 14:51 ): Yeah, yeah. But they just",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 14:51 ): million dollars. It's just yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 14:51 ): Yeah, and we're gonna see. So Ian email me, he's mailing me sometime this week or maybe next week, he's mailing we did this systolica, Rachel that we taped out we finally got, I was two or three years ago. and so he's gonna mail me those. And so we actually test my car, we got our ai chip working. I think,'ll be that in, and of itself will be a good selling point for raising money. Because my big pitches, if you're gonna raise money, you've got to answer the question, Why do you need this money at the answer, is, We're gonna hire some people, they're going to do some stuff.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 14:51 ): It's like, okay, but this isn't really a plan, I'm getting so many defensible. If the answer is We're gonna use it for training, we're gonna be renting a bunch of hardware, we're gonna be buying and video hardware. We're gonna be, using cloud hardware, and then we're gonna have some better model, it's like, That's gonna Absolutely. That's not a very good use of money.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 14:51 ): And yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 14:51 ): The other hand you basically say We're gonna take the money, and we are going to actually tape out ai chips. We're gonna compete with that video and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 14:51 ): ",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 14:51 ): make chips and we're going to, stick even the browser on the chip idea. I think is a good long-term goal because Not only is it like the idea is, it's not the AI chip but in addition, it's what are you actually using the AI to build that's connected to the ground? True. That seems like an intractively difficult problem.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 14:51 ): And the browser on the trip is the perfectly intractively difficult problem because there's busy nothing proprietary about it. It's not like going anything. we're gonna help someone build a dam and you're like. Yeah, but we don't actually have the contract to build a dam. Yeah, there's a risk involved with all the stuff like the brows too. The only crazy part of the browser of the chip is that it's too hard, but that's the perfect thing to basically say, Okay, that's what you can, and the trick is like, even if you can't build it, you can get a thousand patents along the way, And then you have this defensibility in the semiconductor space, and then more importantly, if you have an AI chips that you're using to, then actually do your training actually,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 14:51 ): Okay.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 14:51 ): build your models, actually figure out what the next step in AI is even with feedback and maybe it's not the same architecture, that we're currently using you you have, that ability to do that and\u2026",

  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 14:51 ): I don't know that. I'll fight you Alpha. Such this news I am not read about it, but I have heard. They have bought something that little chip design.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 14:51 ): Of the trip. interesting.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 14:51 ): yeah. That's good to check out.",

  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 14:56 ): Mmm.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 14:56 ): Yeah, so deep mind is actually, I would argue one of the very few companies. That is kind of doing it,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 14:56 ): Yeah, I was actually. Moon.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 14:56 ): And actually, having deep thing and they are purely R&D. you\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 14:56 ): Mmm.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 14:56 ): they're really have a huge budget that they're not expected to be profitable because they're inside of Google and they're not focused on transformers exactly. They're focused on reinforcement. Learning ground truth techniques with feedback that then sometimes use trends, that they use language models to kind of give suggestions and to kind of give hypotheses because at the end of the day that's\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 14:56 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 14:56 ): what it's good for it. So for a couple weeks here that came out from now, is everything they have has Alpha through beginning. So it's very confusing but it was Alpha something and maybe she was a geometry solver that would solve. you're very high scores on these are competitive geometry proof, contest day with this, but it was based on the idea that behind the scenes, they're like doing multiple techniques that involve",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 14:56 ): Mmm.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 14:56 ): symbol, actual proofs under the hood, And the combining that would reinforcement warning combined that with lens to generate suggestions what's a technique that that might work in this case and then they try it the very quickly and actually can consistently prove Okay, no, that didn't work or This isn't correct with that feedback. And so, yeah, this Alpha chip, I mean, I kind of knew a few years ago",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 14:56 ): It was like, they're using the reinforcement learning to solve the chip problem. And then it would interesting to see how to read more about this of What are the exact techniques that they're using and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 14:56 ): Yeah, we",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 14:56 ): and particularly, when you have these systolic array matrix multipliers, There are a lot of trip design specific cases that who seem like they be useful for the biggest one is There is circuit simulation, You remember from college and stuff, I'm sure you did like statics or circuit theory or something. We're basically have giant linear algebra problems.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 14:56 ): yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 14:56 ): That are traditional systems of linear equations that model like this. You don't finite element analysis and some domain with it So I keep transfer. Yeah. Static circuit theory all the same math problem and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 14:56 ): Yeah. Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 14:56 ): they're very very well suited to having Matrix, They're matrix multiplications We get the heart of it mostly it in college it's like gosh I got to set up all these equ.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 14:56 ): And then if you had a tool I don't know if you guys use Matlab or what Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 14:56 ): Yeah, I use it. Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 14:56 ): I mean at the end of the day that left is all right do matrix multiplication here and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 14:56 ): Mmm.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 14:56 ): so I could see why the circuit design problem there's a lot of these sub problems that you convert them to linear systems through well known existing techniques like folks there's all right now at our chip should be able to do that and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 14:56 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 14:56 ): Yeah, and I assume this is the okay so this is the other part with the",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 14:56 ): A lot of the modern, chip design is based on this idea that, You have these electronic design automation tools and with every new process that comes out, right? The Fabs are the ones who really have the only ones the beginning. When there's a new process, the really deeply understand how it's gonna break the previous models, they models, but the previous simulation, tools and techniques for developing circuits. and then because they kind of find that the hard way when they can't quite do something more. Okay, these things don't scale linearly basically. And then What happens is you these EDA companies, though. So there's three big ones. So there's semen's now has bought Metro Graphics. They're one of the big ones and then Cadence and Synopsis, and the three of them are sure industries that they work with companies like Tsmc and Intel to kind of actually build out the software and",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:01 ): Use of all right, dimensions. we have those new technique, good. I take care of, thermal a key is a Big Issue now or verification or all these kind of things that come along and then they say Okay our tool does that and then the ideas you get a pdk which help process Design Kit. And basically it is a standard format and represents the actual data from the fab that can be plugged into one of those edholds to then actually simulate a circuit. Then you have the fabulous, somebody connector companies are basically going in, They pay a lot of money to, Have these tool license, the tools. But typically for the most advanced node for certain senior people like architects, it can be about a million dollars per year more practically you generally at older process nodes It's like tens of thousands of dollars per year Percy and there's no great a hundred thousand dollars per seat for years probably the average really.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:01 ): For a lot of production work but they're expensive. that's kind of the point, Very expensive and your licenses, there's very few semiconductor and video only has I think about 3,000 semiconductor engineers. Right? That's really not very many people that build their core,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:01 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:01 ): product and then they used, tsmc's process, they probably use Cadence My guess the most expensive one, for their EDA tools and they have internal form verification languages, like internal proprietary tools that build on top of that. And so, it's kind of this game, What do we want to keep to ourselves? What's a commodity that we get from these other companies? And then we get to them pay for these multi project wafers and tape out. So, a big part of this is you can't really get access to the commercial process design kids unless you plan on actually making a chip.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:01 ): I mean it kind of makes sense in these. It's a tightly held intellectual property secret and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:01 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:01 ): therefore, I want the data, from your fab. but to do multi-project wafers for anything that's not a very, very advanced note is typically it's about 6,000 dollars.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:01 ): To $10,000 that kind of range for a lot of process notes. Doing everything So from the year, 1995 and 2000 all the way up to basically 65 nanometers running back 2010, or something, you're kind of just paying the bout, the same rate, and that doesn't include these EDA tools. That's just actually make a test ship where you get about a hundred of them. And the idea of the multi project wafer is making the mask, is the very expensive cost, right? So, that's 90% of the cost is, they use these EB machines and actually edge this mask. And the trick is instead of just having one design, production designs, typically have a design repeated over and over again right across what's called radical which is the actual size. It kind of gets stamped out and that's how big the mask is. So there's a big wafer and they step this reticula cross and kind of stamp out photography make all these chips. But the idea is",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:01 ): If you do a full reticule, then you kind of say, okay, if these modern AI chips kind of except for, they're full reticule chips. Meaning they're at the maximum size, but historic, we'd always be even an Intel CPU for 10 years ago, there'd be four or six of those per radical and then you got a lot of a competitive system shift, there's 20 or 30 and they're just their feet over and over again because the whole point is, once you're in production, you just want to be pouring out chips, right? To? Minimize your cost and make them, but when you're doing design, you do a multi project wait for where every couple months out as particular process TSMC will do one of these group front. Basically. It's like I want five millimeters of space and then there's all these different designs on the same mass of different people, right? And then you share the cost Basically, there's some third party company like Muse your practice two or three of",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:01 ): basically then organize the whole thing, And you kind of work with them rather than working with TSMC directly,",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:01 ): And then you guys are like,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:01 ): Right.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:01 ): I want to pay for these multi project wafers, And then you go ahead, your design to them, They aggregate those designs and they put them on this thing and that's why. Even if it costs these older process nodes, two hundred thousand dollars for mass, it only costs $6,000 for the minimum size of the multi project there because you're only getting a couple millimeters of space. So it's not usually enough space by the time you basically get it, big enough to test your whole chip for everything but sort of these really really small chips. It's usually not worth it to do a multi project wafer because it's cost is relatively similar, So at that it's usually better to just kind of do a full mask and then the rule of thumb with someone here design is usually it's like the third times, the charms type of thing. The first two full attempts you make fail, Because you're kind of getting these on a schedule and it's based on the fact that you're paying those money for Ed.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:06 ): Roles. They're paying a lot of money for the semiconductor engineers. You don't really want to wait until the very end to, I would test it,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:06 ): We got that tested and",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:06 ): but on the other hand so expensive. So you kind of create this timetable. So this is why even though it's only 40 million dollars for a four, nanometer, mask, apple, and Sony. And Nvidia spend about a billion dollars for full design costs, for one of those ships, and that includes all all the intellectual property licensing, all the EDA tools plus. The fact that they're doing all these multi project waivers and then they're probably doing three 40 million dollar tape outs before they say. Okay, this one really needs to work and they're doing that In the traditional rule of thumb is an 18 month timeline companies in Town and they didn't see use. I and video.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:06 ): Even though it seems like they come out with a chip every year, it's not exactly true. I think what really happened with the a100 was kind of delayed by six months, there wasn't really something before the a100 that came out a year earlier that was directly lineage.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:06 ): Know.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:06 ): And they have multiple teams with different products coming out kind of concurrently. So, Nvidia is because Nvidia turns out like the chips to make actually aren't very complex.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:06 ): Okay.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:06 ): That's actually the real magic of Nvidia is if you look at a CPU design, like Intel makes or Apple, is the most extreme which would and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:06 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:06 ): what it is. So complex because it is trying to optimize around hundreds, if not thousands of different use cases and problems, And so traditional CPUs would have really complex branch, prediction of all these pipelines, but at the end of the day, they don't know what code is gonna run on that CPU, and it needs to work for lots of",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:06 ): Point code basis. And then it was Apple there. Truly optimizing for not even at that level of just, Basic Code base. They're optimizing for their actual suite of software and companies like Adobe. And so they have the LVM team. They acquired they have thousands of employees, written compilers and all this stuff to then actually get into building that. So again, and so I mean it's insanely complex right? What Apple has and that's the reason why they work with arm they The course, right arm is designing these scores. They're doing all this other complex stuff and video at the end of the day. They just build things that do lots of multiplication and they have forever, I mean, that's kind of the beauty. the founded and video came from AMD when they're working on CPU and kind of try to pitch the concept of a GPU internally in the 90s and AMD that's too niche of a use case and",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:06 ): The three people you founded Nvidia all kind of an agreement But look at graphics is gonna be such a thing that there's finally this other use case that you can actually have relatively simple designs. and just kind of They scale up with every process node, there's an insatiable appetite for rendering, It's just the nature of at the time 90s so yeah, people always want to render more polygons. I mean, whether it's for games or movies or everything and then that kind of, in recent years have been other use cases, especially Bitcoin. Mining was actually just really big use case that propelled Nvidia to be able to build these very large chips profitably. loud researchers to actually do AI.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:06 ): I mean, it's a weird chicken of the eighth egg thing, but if it weren't for mining like a crypto mining, it would be very easy for their not to have been this ai moment. Because, would there How would you profitably have sold hardware? that inflexible is one way to put it because graphics actually, when you actually get in the games and rendering they tend to have actually Relatively complex pipelines for the fact that they're trying to just aggressively stream pixel, right? a they have this shader language that's, fairly likes to and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:06 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:06 ): so those are going to take a step back, right? It's like you have the weird semiconductor world that the expenses really large? But it's so defensible, you can get patents on the stuff.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:06 ): It seems to me. So the trick is I don't really think venture capital is want to invest in semiconductor businesses. I mean not only have I heard that from a venture capitalist that it went to and this is like a defense event, but I mean I hope you learned your lesson. He was like,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:06 ): Big.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): I was like, Yeah, I talked with some people on the Bay Area, no one, see what can not start or raise enough money to build a semiconductor company. He was like, Yes. that was good. So you learned that and my whole thought was No, I shouldn't have learned that. you guys are being so dumb like you and the venture capital ecosystem. you're investing in garbage company, but I mean it's because it's worked well for the last 20 or 30 years, but you very much are admitting that you have no interest in actually, innovating deeply at a moment where it's also really clear to you, that that's what's happening.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Then.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): And so it's just this self-consistent thing of wait, if everybody sees Nvidia, then why are they willing to give it a shot to develop a semiconductor company, that's competitive. And here's the trick, I think, that goes hand and go up with this idea that if you expect the models to be the same size, they are now then,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): it is very different because you need to build these very advanced process nodes and in constant, 40 million dollar plus, the EDA tools, plus the IP license, that's the other one. I don't really talked about that. At the end of the day, if you want to build a working chip, you are gonna be violating other people's patterns, right? you're not gonna suddenly be able to not worry about owning anything and then, even\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): if so you either have to say We're just gonna license, actual property from them which often is completed circuits, right?",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Then.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): And then he wishes. Even in video usually say, Okay, we have these third parties that already have a working ram in her face. So working, Matt I SRAM we have, radio stuff, we have voltage regular. We have all these kind of components that are tested and a lot of the world's as hard IP meaning the actual block that's gonna go into the final trip has actually already been tested in a multi-project wafer and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): characterized on a certain process and so the idea is not only are you saving yourself development costs by not. Reinventing the wheel which saving the time to market. Because if you had to go and take every sub-design you had and then run that on a particular process, in a multi project wafer to kind of prove and characterize. That it's not just prove that it works, it's actually characterizing it to know so you're not quote overly pessimistic because you can only get a chip to work by playing it safer and adding more margins.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Right. \u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:11 ): ",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): over the clock speed. we'll just assume that it goes a little slower versus say,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Okay, we prove what it actually does and we test it out, But I think the trick is, if you basically say No, no you don't necess These models don't necessarily need to be that big and that was another thing I just saw today, AMD has started coming out with a couple of these 135 million parameter models that run on their hardware, Yeah, and then the based on llama and it's like, So I think the reality is what there's a few reasons why you don't need as many parameters. What the big one is, you don't need the knowledge now, would you not need the knowledge to be in the model? But it's incredibly counterproductive because then you have absolutely no way to control.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): What the context actually is producing a particular output Just always under control. the thing is always 90%, pretty good and always makes mistake that's worthless. It always might make some mistake. then you always need somebody double checking and that's not valuable, And then the other one, though, that's even deeper, even if you got rid of a lot of the knowledge and had it be focused on reasoning. You still probably currently get to these.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): models are somewhat bigger than 135 million parameters, but more deeply, I think the transformer architecture itself is so grossly inefficient in how it maps tokens. And the fact that the tokens are designed to represent those breadth of human knowledge if I think of it as sequence to sequence modeling right. The fact it's kind of designed to handle very inaccurate language and real human language is also closely inefficient when you're trying to solve real problems in the same way that if I was talking to someone and we're talking about some really deep academic topic or research topic. And then I said, great! You can talk about vocabulary about fifth grade or that's fine. No, it's not fine. that would be worthless and how do you be both that? It can talk as a fifth grader and a 10th grader and a graduate, it's like don't be able to do all those things like",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): A lot of ways to parameters only, we're gonna talk about,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:11 ): ",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): something characters. I only talk a graduate level semiconductor. She's like, I don't want to hear would sound like to a fifth grade to write a poem,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Moving. yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): it's just Like I was talking about my dad because we found some Writing samples from our girls, My brother was a kid. He's a goal, he's like, but I wouldn't be able to generate this I'm like",
  "01 (2024-09-30 15:11 ): 00:00",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): But it's almost like, maybe That's not even really the point because there's no feedback because why do you even care? A second grader writes Not because of what the writing is because you care about the development of the second grade like the writing is garbage. They're in the whole point and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): So I think, the big idea here, is one patents should be the long term idea which also means, ponds are basic legal documents. we know I think is actually an interesting use case it matters more than something like, marketing is kind of irrelevant and the reason is you have something that's truly better. You just need to express that idea, and then the volume of marketing that you need to express. Why? A better thing better is actually connected to ground, truth of the thing.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): I was reading a bunch of articles, this weekend about slop and just It also explains What is the current industry doing? who is actually using AI a lot and profitably? It's people that are making terrible Not good marketing, but bad marketing just volume of crap to use on social media because volume matters nowadays and costs there for matters. And so, it's SEO drive Exactly. We were talking about being like, you go on Mars, you see what the SEO says you should make then you literally automatically have that on the ants and make that. And then I post that and it's gonna do There was a good article on some magazine that then interviewed so many people that make slop and he came with what people thought was really weird in there for innovative. It's like Jesus made out of shrimp.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): And he was like, no, you don't I went in. I wanted to chatting machine and I asked list the top 10 things that people talk about on the Internet and two of the things and then he put another problem. come buying those into interesting ideas and then he was and then make an image of those and two of the top 10 are food and religion just and so, he's like, it's not something like deep artistic. You know what I\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:11 ): You yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Outline guard. It's literally the combination of the thing in a stupid way. And that's what it is. There's no more depth to it. There's no. And so that slop of just sort of generating",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): That's not The goal is to say how do you connect to some truth and create something of value. so what I'm leaning towards this idea,'m gonna go I think I'll take about a year practically to raise a seed round. I mean, I just think in my experience this idea that it's takes four or five weeks to actually raise right takes four or five weeks. Once you've already spent six months talking to people in private equity, talking to people in the area that you're gonna raise money.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): And then you're like, now and put together, I pitch Jack after I've already had 10 conversations person and they've actually what they wanted and then I go and pitch it to the other partners. And then once I pitch it to one, I go and, two or three other places. But also I think especially adventure capital, it's just bizarre.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Like ecosystem or the whole idea is that they treat themselves as gatekeepers even though their whole job is to supposedly find companies to invest and they have no interest in finding companies to invest in, it's pretty intractable. So then you get to this idea of strategic venture capital if, that's what I say with the opening, I think most of the people on the list that are trying to raise money for our true are actually strategic venture capital. It's like Nvidia and Microsoft and all these other companies that It's not a bad route kind of, but one is the amounts of money.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): If they're big, either tends to be a very tight, coupling, that means you're basically working for that company and I don't actually think that. For example.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Family office.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Yeah, family office and sovereign wealth funds. So, the guy that I talk to here who he was, he was the former chief of staff of the SEC of the Security Exchange Commission, and I saw in a bar, a couple weeks ago, but I was 100%,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:11 ): but,",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Saturn, wild thoughts. that's like, if I told him the whole idea. I was like, this Brad, and incredible parts So he worked for a while for him. Now, he's a lawyer that He's super high profile SEC cases. So, Time, Warner like all these companies, if they actually get sued right by the SEC, and then need to fight that case, I hear people that used to work at the SEC. I mean, the whole thing is gonna go, but he was I know about FPGA I know about, all this, So clearly he has clients already in this area, but he was like, he's like, you not gonna be seas, and raise 40 million dollars for chip",
  "01 (2024-09-30 15:11 ): 05:00",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Family offices. it is possible but you end up having You're one of the big bat of a family. We're family office is right like the super high, net worth individuals, like internal investment group,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Hey.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): somebody who's like a multi-billionaire. They're usually start a family office. It's similar to private equity but it's a lot less.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): String. It's a lot more open-ended because you're just doing effectively a small office associated with a single individual that can have an actual investment strategy. So, somebody I had a friend that worked at a family office and the guy sold a baby formula company to like that. That ended up, they made all the baby from perfect Walmart and family dollar, So they don't always factories that make maybe formula. And so, then he goes, I had an opens up a family. I mean, my guess is when I look, for example, Mumbai where you have a small handful of super high net worth individuals, that then maybe like investing stuff.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:11 ): More.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Those people are probably people that They made a bunch of money and since we're industrial or some sort of, play that has scale, but it's not even necessarily technology. It's just the big thing that required. A lot of capital, and then one of the things they might do is to, have a zoeian",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Is the invest in with, whatever idea that they kind of have for investment strategy and they're all over the place because it really depends on. some people might say Go, I think, pharmaceutical investments are really great. And so that's what I'll do. And a lot of it is private equity, in the sense that As much as most of the people.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): This is my friend that worked in most of these family offices. They're called family offices because they are kind of like the whole idea is What does a person do with a billion or\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:11 ): That's it.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): two or ten billion dollars? They'll probably thinking about some sort of legacy or that type of an approach and therefore a lot of times",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): it's like they don't want to be too risky for our portfolio standpoint right there. Definitely not trying to be like a venture capital firm. That's like we take a bunch of money in. We take these high risk bets but they're with the ridiculously high hurdle rates. Meaning, the reason. most companies fail that are private that are venture capital back. Is that venture capitalists need such short exits.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): It's not simple, it's like, but that's the whole model which is if the whole value comes from time to market. And it's not about technology, it's simply about some market emerges and whoever is first grows the quickest. And growth is the only thing that matters that it's pretty adventure capital\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Yeah, for them. Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): because they force 100 companies under them to grow so quickly that 90% of them die from growing too quickly but that everybody is gonna be growing quickly.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:11 ): yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): They're never gonna run into a problem that someone who's not venture capital back is gonna be one grows there quick. Right? That's what it's built for. and so, private equity is kind of the opposite, the whole",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Most of private equities built from this idea that you stuff like leverage buyouts. That's the bread of butter, private. I mean I was in another restaurant here. I was over at the palm actually and it was funny because they have the power one. So they have a cheap meal, you can get. that's really matter. But it was these two guys talking about private equity and I was kind of listening. I was like, I wonder what and I like, How long is it gonna be until they talk about leverage buyouts and two minutes later. They're like, Yeah, we'll leverage by and I'm like Yeah, that's all you do. that is 90% of what you understand doing. The idea with the leverage buyout is Imagine you're like a restaurant chain,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Mmm.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): right? That's doing pretty well and you've got five or 10 or 15 restaurants and some regional area and that this model works, right? And\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Yeah, and yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): then you're gonna go ahead and say We need a franchise. we need to get up to your studies economies of scale.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): What you generally do is a private equity. Firm is the perfect person to buy your company. It creates an exit for the founders, which is usually what they want. But the private equity firm could also go and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:11 ): He?",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): what we're gonna do is We're gonna pour in some equity, but more importantly, we're gonna get a ton of debt financing from a bank and we can go and do that because we have a lot of cash, behind us. And then we're gonna do is, and that's the idea part of the leverage buyout, right? it's this idea that",
  "01 (2024-09-30 15:11 ): 10:00",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): The company when the founders run it is inherently kind of under capitalized and kind of has a difficult time leveraging itself, But if you think leverage in the sense of a mortgage, right? there's a fixed asset here. So you a percent down and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): own that asset. But the reason someone's willing to give you that loan is they know the collateral is pretty robust and stable, And it's like, Okay, if you fail, to be able to pay us back The asset, is that thing versus the problem is if you have some under capitalized business, it's inherently the under capitalization of the business itself, that prevents further capitalization, It's risky. if they had a bunch of cash, I would give them more cash because it's not very risky to give, caches has cash. And so the trick then is, there tendency is big non-linearity with leverage buyouts where it's like, private equity, firm comes up. The trick though, is they have to make the numbers work. And therefore, it's based on this idea that they look at.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): It to prepare for a leverage by it. You usually doing stuff like really making our Super lean and cutting your costs. Because the leverage buy is really good. The private records, really gonna look at those numbers and say Is this gonna generate cash? because we need to pay back a debt position. Right. \u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Hey.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): we can't. And so the thing with private equity is, it's very debt oriented. I don't think it's particularly well, suited for R&D. I mean, I'm surprised how much I hear about private equity in this area in the DC area as sort of, that's what's funding AI. I think the reality is though, when it's funding it's funding, what I'll call classic like Data Science Consulting Company.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Yeah. Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Because that is actually perfect for private equity, right? To say, Okay, the government and all these federal contractors and all this whole health care and this whole ecosystem consulting that's in the DC area, at the end of the day, a consulting company that has 30 employees that has some contracts is gonna be able to have contracts, right? And, you know that the more cash they have, the more they can hire people and then they can have a broader portfolio of human capital to then put on these consulting things. So it feels a lot like it's working capital for data scientists, right. Our human capital, for example, My friend works, a guide house Bain Capital.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Which they're just a supersized private equity firm. Anything like one of the biggest one but they invested three billion dollars in Chicago's. But guide houses strategy. They were only found four or five years ago and they have 12,000 employees. And They won a 12 billion Ten year contract for a huge defense contract,",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:11 ): What?",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): but the thing at the end of the day, is their model, how they got. So many people was all through acquiring other consulting, companies, and then having all the people join them,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Stuff.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): and so it's Very old-fashioned, kind of anti-ai model. Actually that says, the way you make money is you hire people, and you build those out to other clients. Which that's the challenge. So, when I was looking at this, I'm saying I forget, we're gonna raise money. We got to actually figure out what can we say? We're gonna generate revenue from",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): ",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Consulting is always a good answer, Because at some point, if you're investing a lot in developing deep experts and something, there's gonna be somebody else who has demand for that expertise and you can charge them for that expertise, The challenge becomes. You don't want to get in the same way. We don't want to get sucked into just being some web application. We don't want to get sucked in some low value consulting company,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): that chases consulting opportunities because we need it to generate revenue. so then the trick becomes that's where family office and sovereign wealth funds, become the obvious kind of thing and probably a combination of the two, right where it's like when you start with family office, because if you're gonna raise A hundred thousand dollars two hundred thousand dollars a family office is probably the right?",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): It's a reasonable right now and then you still got to figure out Exactly on the milestones. Exactly what's the pitch rather than just saying it was just already? I think the trick of the whole thing is also playing into this deeper idea. I'm saying, what's really like if you look at software eating the world you say everything revolves around software. What's kind of the problem with software? And again, it really comes. Unlike cyber security, If it weren't for security, it would be very easy. Actually to kind of develop a lot more software and the problem. And so when you look at cyber security, a lot of the weakness of cyber security Is a fact that it doesn't connect to hardware and is probably correct way. You don't even know you install a bunch of dependencies, you have no idea what's in them and then you kind of get bogged down, developing some application, making these trade-offs with security and you have these",
  "01 (2024-09-30 15:11 ): 15:00",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Disconnect between security and application about.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:11 ): I think it's",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Practically. Yeah. And the only way to connect those to is actually do all the way from the bottom up, like a first principles approach and the beauty of that is you don't need. And so, here's my kind of thesis is that you're gonna build a secure application. You don't need the most advanced ships,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:11 ): A.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): you can build chips that are 350 nanometers, from the late 90s basically because if you some secure server, that actually works, look at how little the server That we built, the chat and even the AI part of the business you just makes requests to other third-party AI thing. If it's not the actual GPU, it does so little",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:11 ): ",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): You think about some one user goes on there that prompt gets turned into a network packet on their end. It's sent out to our server, the network stack takes that and decodes that network packet, it's only, we're like writing it to the disc. And then we're sending another network back to some other server. That's all the top.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): And we can make it super use data, but the database is really complex. For the end of the day. It's writing the data to the disk, it's not doing a lot of processing there and again, even a database. It's that. So we want to grab those relational database. if you structure the code to denormalize that data and make the rights more complicated, those complicated rich are still just right. They're writing to a few additional location but at the end of the day, the CPU isn't doing much, It's just you're right. That's a memory That's This address That's right. Even in general the database it's just multiplying. If it had to do a lot, it wouldn't be performing, right? And this idea what's a connection? it's some",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Some number that represents that person that then sends a network request. And even when you look at the network is, okay, encryption is like there you go. That's actually doing most of the work on our server. We actually look at it, it's like encrypting and decrypting. The data coming off The wire is 90% of the actual CPU process and so you don't need that much use. It's not very our sensitive. And therefore, the tape up to 330 Even production came about for us to actually say We have a chip, you can buy, or We have a data, We have a rack that we as a consulting company, can provide you some secure solution. here's this piece of hardware that you put in your premise thing.",

  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Would need, yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): so I think a lot of that at the other day it's like you try to piece by as you simulate the thing, you have an LLM kind of suggest something in some way. And then the trick is even for so I think actually developing a chip is really good because that demonstrates this defense, we're a semiconductor company, we have a chip, we get a couple patents on that having the AI write the patents, I think, as they keep again, that's the connect to ground truth to where it's like. Yeah, we've researched the country. Know what those words actually mean, we What we're doing is the right claim here and again and so very open because at the end of the day every patent is published. It's not like there's a secret proprietary knowledge. and yeah because that's the other person even if we thought that somehow I don't. But what opening I doing what Anthropic is doing is actually that good.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): We're still fighting this uphill battle by basically saying, they have all these users in there for their collecting. All these use cases. the thing, feeds itself with the budget to answer this, very wide thing because that was the other realization. I had with the chat, which was like, We're never gonna be able to prove this works. because chat is all the things like we're letting somebody type in anything here and\u2026",

  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): you for us to ever wrangle with that. it's ironically like an easy application in the big screen things to build right that but it's like an impossible application to be good and to get to work well And so I think the trick is focusing. Here's these five. So I kind of have five long-term things. I think can be like this is what the focus.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): is gonna be on. So one is patents to his action Developing semiconductors. I'm going to about the third is consulting, probably in that type of area. So probably when we consulting for other, semiconductor companies or other",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Ai companies, not necessarily some end user or then we're getting back down, some law firm wants us to help, do something like that. The other one is AI R&D Fundamentally. I mean, I do think that this is one thing about six months ago that I do it either. These fundamental ideas that we actually can develop that are based on really changing\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:11 ): ",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): how the transformer architecture requires us to take a lot of time. It's different. The thing with R&D is You can never go inside, I know this is gonna work, right? You have to be kind of like next week there's like my gosh,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Really.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): this idea, hit me. We gotta figure out how we can try that. How do we even approach testing that or developing it? And a lot of that comes from these, eval, what we can do in the short term is tackle more difficult, technical problems with a first principles of approach and then say How do we automatically capture everything? We're doing so that these emails kind of automatically happen, everything you have",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Automatically, we need to have this either. The ARMANTRA needs to Let the AI do it. we have to record we're doing anything It should only be as an experiment to that understand how the AI kind of has to attack. We should never be doing anything if we're doing it,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Mmm.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): doing it wrong because the AI has to do it. Those are always just gonna get further and further behind and The final one really gets down to call them browser on the trip. I put here secure communications platform, but at the end of the day,",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:11 ): .",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): People a lot of this just comes under What is it really look like to have quote, a secure application, but it's so deeper than that, we talk about fishing and root of trust. And this idea of okay, our thing has email, but do we trust our email provider? Do we trust these fundamental technologies? SMS is insanely untrustworthy when it comes like sim card swapping attacks and spoofing of telephone numbers. I mean it's kind of crazy.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Email is okay. In that, at least you have, DK, I am, and SPF and demark. So, you have these standards, that really allow prevention is moving, but you're also on the hook for your own infrastructure. It's a highly decentralized infrastructure. That means if you don't implement it correctly, or don't do it correctly.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): You don't really know that you're getting all the guarantees that come along with it and then the reality is draw fishing perspective. Email is just filled with spam and you can't really trust anything. You get by any of these communication channels and so both are technical solution that basically said in my opinion. if I meet someone in DC here and I want to have a communication with them, I shouldn't be given that business card that email address or QR code, or going on LinkedIn. I mean, it's insane. I went to one of these defense conferences and guys like you got to be on LinkedIn. I was like Yeah, but it's anybody in a terribly insecure, anybody can connect you. Anybody can give you a link and then you're going to zero day attack and you have people, he's like you can. The front door is open. You can talk to that General by connect with the LinkedIn. I'm that's insane. That's so dumb. stop doing that. was my argument to him and it was just really funny thing. We're looking we can't because at the end of the day, we need to balance",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Okay, but I mean, I think something where it's much more, No, I have a physical device that I give you, that has a chip in it. That's probably works, actually the credit card systems",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Are pretty good because they have Cap or the chip. It's like those are relatively robust like they mail you a physical thing that has a chip in it. That's pretty reasonably. Trusted supply chain. And then you go ahead and you're like all right I know this thing is me and the weakness of the system is it's not the only way to pay last week I had credit card fraud against the business debit card so getting a new debit card and the flippers I only spend it or only seven expenses. It's all the AI services and then paying the rent for this space and paying you via wise and so I never once used it as an actual car, Just sit, I mean they're like have you giving away your pin number?",
  "01 (2024-09-30 15:11 ): 25:00",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): I was like I don't even know what the pin number is it's literally in my filing cabinet at home on some piece of paper and that's you I'm never taking cash out with it. It's like",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Five or six expenses. And the reality is, I wonder whether it's a debit card or whether it's the actual ACh transaction or something that was because I used it as a de as a federal contractor. So terribly insecure on government sites in my opinion that they're like, you have to put All your bank account number, all this stuff they want me to use the bank account number as the user ID is\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Awesome.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): what you have, and there's no encryption And it's like, this is insane. But every other 70,000 federal business,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): small business federal contractors have to use that portal if they want other people to be able to search for them.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): The amount of them, I get 10 to 15 calls a day from people that are reaching out and emails that are just like, you're a federal contractor. Do this? it's so much spam and so much fishing and so you literally can't respond to an email. You can't respond to a text, You can't pick up the phone. You can't apparently have a bank account music here. the whole thing is, it's insanely insecure system\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): but guys and that's part of the reason why six months ago I was interested in being, it was like there's so much room for improvement and there's so much cash that you can actually solve these problems. But with the government, the more, over the last six months it is so slow-moving. It is not built for actually innovative solutions or anything like it's not the right approach. I mean I think at some point I'll probably just gonna cancel the",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Yeah, being the federal contractor and maybe it's good. Simply if we're truly an R&D company, there are certain R&D grants rather than fat contracts, right? Where the grants are much more like you just propose something and there's money for the National Science Foundation stuff like that. Especially those part of the reason I set up is the Chips Act, right? So there's hundreds of millions of dollars and all these something character research grants. And so it's that's more reasonable because then it's universities often get them. But there's a lot of private partnerships in semiconductor. Where it's like you work with some university that has and then you work with someone conductor company and you're doing this other research. So I think it's crazy that it doesn't cost anything. So who work for getting this fraud on the card that I wouldn't consider getting rid of because all the spam it's fine. I'm not, what I mean? It's not.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Any of that, I'm not gonna answer my phone anyway because all the fishing and spam. And so it is what it is. But to me,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): there's definitely an opportunity for this next generation of just I'll just call text messaging.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): That's like this thing just works. It's actually secure and the requirement is like every person you want to establish a connection with you, have to physically hand them an object and it seems insane but at least that way you can have a handful of people with its in a business or\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): people and trust that you're like if we really need to communicate with each other, I know that I'm trusting you and especially the world of deep things, I think which preventing that from happening in the short term is people kind of trust someone calls me on the phone, they sound like That's probably my mother. Right? But that window is closing very quickly. There's been a couple CEOs they have, giving away the keys to the kingdom of big enterprise companies because they got deep fakes, a family members and they're like, my gosh, like you need, and it's like, Okay, that's crazy. you can't, that's a big attack surface and you see that more and simply become cheaper",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): For there's no, I might the other thing, I thought, all this safety talk when it comes to disinformation at, a personal level, like deep faking someone's family member for a fishing attack, the cat is out of the bag. you're not gonna be able to prevent that, we are moving rapidly towards that, just being cheaper and cheaper and there's no slowing down there.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): and I think for the summit, where we can and that's the other reason why the chat thing. I think it's just like the safety part of it is weird because it's not powerful enough in some way to actually care about safety in some deep way. if you don't connect to ground truth, you're not going to build a bioap, you're not going to build a missile or something. It is not good enough, On the other hand, if you're like, How do I write a lie? Do you really need aI to write a 10 cents a lot. If you're talking about disinformation, at the end of the day, it doesn't be true in the first place.",
  "01 (2024-09-30 15:11 ): 30:00",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): It's just more slop, Almost doesn't matter from a safety perspective and then you get stuff like deep fakes where it's like, there's pretend not so much with a chatbot. But with some video in particular I mean I think that's the big risk with video as well where it's like What's the upside of video and What's the downside unless all the way with video to work to be like this makes production movies and advertising, you're just generating slop and deep things and the upside potential slop is not very high and the downside potential deep fakes",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Is quite high. and so I think at the end of the day, the big ideas, we want to shift towards these deep technical things that I can leverage my, personal expertise with that are differentiated and more important connect us to some sort of ground truth. So we're not stuck in this soft mushy.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): And then fundamentally rethink. what are these models? Even look And the biggest was, yes, this gets back to the idea of I would just really three chips that I want to build. This is what we're really gonna be building, might take a long time to get there and everything will be building towards this. But this idea is we're gonna build a chip. That is a cheap older process. No chip. That's basically like a server for secure application just it's a CPU basically but it's a CPU or we can say here we know exactly what it's doing and we can automatically generate code the formerly runs on top of it and that having AI generate the full stack on top of it.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): From first principles we don't have dependency problems and so it overcomes any downside to being on an older process node is that it is not doing a zillion think when you look at these dependencies of a node project and then being like, what is the CPU actually doing 99% of, it was doing is not needed. It's not like it's only doing the algorithm that matters. It's doing a zillion things more, even when it comes on a memory management. The operating system all that stuff, you don't need that. where we're going, we don't need an operating system. Right.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Because we're doing a whole program analysis, know exactly what the target chip is. And so when you see that, in the AIC description for the application, it needs to generate and test and prove the full application running on the chip, right whole program analysis with formal verification where the output of the LM is not the end result. It's simply a hypothesis. Yeah, a suggestion of a path for exploration is probably the best way to describe it.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): So that's kind of really and then an AI trip. So the idea of the AI chip is we can't build that for nanometers to expensive but getting up to 22 nanometers, there's a two million dollar mass cost is probably the goal, the AI chip. And in the same thing with the browser on check, where there's a full browser The browser on ship should be like the end. That's where it's like, okay, we have defensible patents, we have a browser on chip. We're selling that to every single OEM like HP, and Dell, and Lenovo, Eastern everybody and selling this, $20 chip that has, 80% margins on it or something and it's like, yep, that's it. You get to nvidia. Yeah, type of level of life and then the beauty that's a really clear. Thing, you'll say, Since this is the end game, this is how we're gonna raise round after round after round, and how we're gonna investors to say, Yeah, we're gonna exit for a billion, or 10 billion or a hundred billion dollars. It's because we are chip is gonna be defensively.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): That goes. the month, the future of communication and security is built on our browser,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:11 ): That's yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): on a chip, which will the whole thing securely. But also why I think Richard is for our AI stuff. We want to build it on our AI chipsets and the trick that is we want to go this AMD route of A hundred million parameters or less. I think even less is actually gonna be sufficient, I think, partially, and building smaller building, two bit, quantization, or maybe four bit quantization. But I think even two-bit actually is probably might be,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:11 ): One more thing. I'm not explaining our own tradition.",

  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:11 ): there was something like a bar,\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Yeah, this is for the Neuromorphic computer. Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:11 ): mister type of thing, something that",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Yeah, so, I mean the Neuromorphic computing is interesting, So something we're gonna have to, kind of keep up with, but it gets down to this same idea, which is",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): It's still gonna be a more efficient way to solve the fuzzy problem, And fundamentally that gets the problems is the goal to reproduce a person with all of the uncertainty and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:11 ): ",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): undeterminism that a person has, right? Because at the root of this comes back to the same. So, if you think of even that, transformer architecture all these matrix multiplications, especially the large floating point numbers, right? They might be binary when you get down to the transistor level, but at the end of the day, they're trying to through big brute force reproduce, large sort of fuzzy system. Does that have lots of connect zillions of input civilians of outputs and have basically an analog range of and if you look like fp32 for training FB 16, Sure it's not analog. But that is a lot of possible states, that number can be in. And then you're basically said, Okay, what's the downside to that you have?",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Absolutely no idea. Why you got the answer did or whether you got the answer. You got is correct, So I think the Neuromorphic computing, Is very interesting, I do think there's something. Also be said for this idea that as we focus on our research, trying to think of this idea of How do you as a human work really well? And then, Where are they doing biome? Mimicry to kind of understand for example, with the transformers, it's easy stateless, it's like, I'm not stateless right? I am currently updating my state periodically and doing what a background activity. and so that's good with the neuromorphic computing. it might be a",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): a way to kind of do that fuzzy part, the LLM kind of part really efficiently. So rather than doing matrix, we're even seeing this in stuff that's not necessary called neuromorphic computing, but it's simply like analog multiplication, right? We're like, I want to mix these signals together and I don't need having a zillion. Discreet Digital transistors, is not really the most energy efficient way, but by the very nature of it, you lose precision, you lose repeatability because you have this analog effects, As a temperature changes, you get different answers And generally speaking from everything I read about neuromorphic computing, that sort of the problem, Is your measuring analog voltages at some level, you're really trying to build this thing that's like,",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): It just does the thing and it were and it's This is the way human is, that's good. I don't think it seem like that's not gonna be important or something like that but I think the reality is right,",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): When you're like, I want to build a browser. I want to build this really complicated engineering problem. The problem has been the way around. They're like, I have all these mistakes, right. Whereas, take the circuit theory like setting up those linear equations, right? It turns out like, I remember taking those exams and finally, realizing that the hard part of this is not conceptual, the hard part of this is like if I'm doing paper and pencil setting up these doing matlab or something like I can't make any mistakes. There is the circuit on the paper to do the test, I need to perfectly transcribe that I remember feeling like isn't the computer better in doing this, that I like the problem is They're not representing this in the right format, in the first place because they want me to learn this intuition about this idea, which is good for the end of the day. If they just represented the circuit formally in a program, would be easier for a program, which is generating the equations and solve the thing, right? \u2026",
  "01 (2024-09-30 15:11 ): 40:00",

  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): The circuit theory, very simple translation. And then you get, going back to those engineering exams. It's The real hard part, where a human is good, is that create creative, exploration of the solution space and the reframing of problems. So that you're solving the right problem in the first place. And then coming up with What are all I ride, one professor, who is very focused on those creative solutions and one professor who's very much just wrote, doing the road stuff really well and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:11 ): We?",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): it was a good balance but the creative will give problems on the exam",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): come with as many ways as possible to send a signal across the Atlantic Ocean, more points for the more you come up with and you get extra credit. So you can go with a hundred different, kind of creative ways to, solve a problem I remember early on, we had these problems that weren't really electrical engineering. We're just like, Here's a list of objects. there's a ping pong ball in a two and you have to figure out how to get the ping pong ball out of the tube in as many ways as possible, right? And so then you have a sticky thing, you put it on it. and there's a lot of other creative ways to account without using much of anything. But okay here's how you get the ping pong brought in the two but anyway that's the part where it's weird way language models can be good.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): That if you increase the temperature but not just the temperature in the real model because they're too complex to get useful answers once you kind of deviate from the mean. but it's not in that feedback of the rigorous thing. It's in How do I explore this fuzzy space and so that's why I think, Neuromorphic computing can kind of The other thing I think it isn't not even a short run, the next five years, most stuff like that. Neuromorphic computing is based on some alternative",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Non-semiconductor process that's proven, right? And so even\u2026",

  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): there's a lot of stuffers like, that worked on the lab and it's like, How do we actually reproduce that and scale it? And the problem becomes, if underestimating, just how ridiculously efficient the modern, lithography and etching process of semiconductors are to build these discrete lines. Basically, in that, If you can't do that, it costs, effectively you can't build structures, are really tiny because it's so easy to underestimate. for example, Why does it cost 40 million dollars to make a mass? The reason is you have to use an EB machine to etch every line. And it simply takes months on a device that costs 200 million dollars.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Because it takes that long to cut those lines and that's in a pretty efficient thing and then when you actually gonna make the chips, you're not cutting lines anymore, you're doing a full lithography by just shining",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): An EUV beam over the entire radical and cutting, doing the photo mask all at, once you're creating a million or a billion lines in a couple of seconds and then the etching is chemical, right? So it's like printed circuit boards, why semiconductors are just so cheap and almost anything else that you build when you actually get the complexity of the device versus it? Anytime manufacturer, if you look at garment you're like, that shirt costs this amount of money, they're like, How many teams are there? others tendency and\u2026",

It's like, yeah, because it doesn't cost per seem except in that fixed cost ahead of time. And so I think with something like the neuromorphic computing or any sort of, biological computing or even quantum computing, look at how long it took from",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): I'm computing was kind of proven to be this thing to then saying right getting to the point the next year or two. There's gonna be very expensive but commercial quantum computers and fundamentally. The only reason why it's still reasonable is they so aggressively address a certain computational class in a log and time compared to and with classical shooting that there's their use cases but It's still it costs a hundred million dollars of a quantum computer that's 20 qubits, and even then they don't I mean something there's reliability issues when I went to the supercomputing conference. So I go it'll take a year or two and\u2026",
  "01 (2024-09-30 15:11 ): 45:00",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Him. And",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): so the neuromorphic computing there's been a few of these advances that are interesting to see.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): A lot of them are quantum computing where it's like this is so fundamentally different. That it replaces classical computing but a lot of times The answer is much more. How do you merge those together so that you can take this thing, which probably has very, very high cost but solves a certain type of problem. it does solve a certain type of problem, tremendously better.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): And how do you mix? And so, I think the Supercomputing conference was an interesting area where that was kind of happening. And so hybrid quantum super computers, I think are gonna be if you're gonna spend a hundred million dollars on this, part that's the quantum part, you do couple that with another 100 million dollars of just server racks that are doing other problems at complement So I think the neuromorphic computing will address sort of these issue now where you have Maybe these large languages are really really big. But I think the work around of that is like is that really what we're trying? Is it gonna help?",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): What is it? Gonna help us build is our goal to build a replacement for a human. I mean, my kind of idea, over two reasons, one there's a lot of humans and humans already humans. I don't really care. I don't want to be a sideboard in order to really want to haven't even be weirder with things that are not better at solving problems but are just human enough that you feel like empathy for them that it's like, I don't know that. And more importantly. How does that have some commercial use case that I'll show you fun building that thing? Maybe some family offices will just be like I want a robot that's like a person, Okay it's cool. I mean it's hard to argue with that but on the other hand I think what you're gonna see is that things that solve Intractively large problems",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): That's where the money is, right? Things like the browser on the trip, the cure for cancer producing a food source, that's more efficient, a new form of rice, that's 10 times more productive with the same sunlight, right, building energy infrastructure at scale and approvably correctly building cybersecurity. Because when you look at a lot of those other things, the insecurity actually comes from bad cybersecurity in an adversarial geopolitical environment, And I think those are gonna be the things we're like that's of value.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Yeah. Actually.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Like health.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Yeah, and I think that's really patents. Become this clear way to then say, we solve some really technically difficult problem, without worrying about anything other than having to solve the technically difficult problem, right? And then we use this very traditional mechanism to defend and monetize that which is just like great, you made the chip works you've applied for a hundred patent space on the technology develop for that chip and then you got those bad and now you either are going out there and just licensing your companies like Apple and video you're crossing and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Know.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): selling it. Just meaning you have enough patience, maybe you can go down video and say you wasting we get to use what you have patents on. If you get to use what we have patents on,",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): And then we both just go sell our stuff in the market, so we sell AI trips to companies and Nvidia says, Okay, that's fine. And maybe there's some requirements and videos says, you can only license our stuff if you agree not to sell at the most advanced process notes. So okay that's fine\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): because you're wasting power. frankly on the dumb thing, have a smaller models. there's some architectural changes to the models themselves that I think are gonna be really possible by basically not The context as simply this large sequence of dumb tokens, I'll call it but viewing it either as something that's like",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Another word is recall, doesn't just happen in this rag level where it's like now I pull a chunk in and now that chunk is the same as this, thing. It's like every token. When he,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): when your processing information, you think of a token is more of a unit of information that might not even have a word associated with it, It's so much more powerful, we're only producing one token per second and yet we're able to have internally that we're doing more than that. But we're not processing tokens internally, right? We're doing other processes that are probably way more efficient, some of which I visual, the way the brain is organizing visual processing is very difficult to really not use a lot of power because the end of the day, you need a lot of pixels you need to do low level processing on those pixels, that's as well. A lot of AI comes out of the machine vision era.",
  "01 (2024-09-30 15:11 ): 50:00",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Is applied to the sequence modeling, but I don't think the nce. in practice, we think of humans, think a lot more like in trees than sequences, but we communicate vs sequences in language and I think illusion that thought happens in language but There's a",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Yeah that's And then we throw out our words in thoughts. I like that thing. I'm",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): And then the world itself is like a graph right there are feedback happening all the time in cycles.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:11 ): yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Graphs get intractable even for a human understand. So we prefer hierarchies to cycle but we do recognize the fact that life isn't a linear sequence. it's a tree and then It's like we have narratives. For example, we have movies, we have these all try to linearize experience, but at the end of the day, there's a recognition it doesn't mean that's really what it is, right? That's how we're communicating because time passes linearly and we",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): It is. What is? But even a movie is a good example where it's the very nature of you Having pixels on the screen means the visuals in the movie. Don't require only interesting one idea at a time, And that allows this layering of complexity, and then the movie gets reduced in the synopsis to a word, right? Here's the plot like I remember, watch movies are my dad or something like that and it's like, this happened, I'm like, Who cares? What happened? That's not what? Makes a great movie gray. I mean, that's a piece of it. You need to know what happened in the movie.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): but right, there's this deeper complexity of how we process information and software clearly is about hierarchies, It's not about a linear sequence of the tokens in your program. That's not the theory of the program and it just shows that fundamental limitation is if we view everything, as a sequence of sequence, transformation of very large sequences, that allow hyperflexibility over what those sequences represent. it's so grossly and efficient doesn't solve the real problem. And then when you disconnected from feedback, from sort of first principles or ground truth, The whole thing just becomes a muddy mass.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): So okay, So that's the big idea. We'll talk more about that as we go but now it's like we all together. what are we gonna do in the short term, so I have this talk in a couple weeks that I think that's what I'm gonna be focus on tomorrow. Give me the preach up all.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:11 ): That's love.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Flavius and Kyle and the talk is really on using these transcripts, right? And\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:11 ): .",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): then doing rag. So what I was thinking, is that I want to get in this.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): I'm trying I'm kind of torn between part of me wants to just say Let's just forget about the chat entirely just because it just doesn't seem, two valve on the other hand.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:11 ): And yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): You wanted to kind of finish up, whatever if you feel like I'm in the middle of it and I want to do something it's up, but beyond that after the next a few days or the end of the week, definitely I want to shift towards maybe for a couple week more. We're just working on these random projects is that's what's gonna look like with R&D and where I kind of just give you some ideas to kind of work on. And I think in the short term ride can be it, and then as we go, partially, what I want to do is just capturing these calls, these transcripts and then I want to be able to do a better job of having a tool, which I don't really think we want to focus on web development. That's the other thing that kind of learn from the chat, it just takes a lot of time. At the end of the day we need to focus more just like writing scripts that actually focus on the AI stuff.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Probably even though the point where it might make sense to shift, primarily to using Python rather than JavaScript because there's so much of the ecosystem is in Python. We both knows Python but I had to kind of refresh myself a little bit. It's like I'm rusty, the details and then kind of getting more into the data science, AI stuff. And what I want to do with these calls is maybe have more talk about AI teaching you. So let's say Have you do some research on your own and then we build out some of these scripts that eat that. So one is a script that actually reads through the transcript as soon as we get it and then tries to do whatever it says and focus more on maybe. So using some of these AI tools to kind of like bootstrap, some of the stuff and then the same thing with research, keeping up with these research papers automatically. So we're not focused on reading these papers really like searching work tech post, searching our crime.org and kind of up with what is changing.",
  "01 (2024-09-30 15:11 ): 55:00",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): And then going a step further and then really focusing on this building out the semiconductor stuff and somebody else each basic semiconductor stuff. And then, guys, okay, what is this actually gonna look like we're using Llms to the trick? It's not even though I've been, kind of bad-mouthing. Lms is deep idea. It's the problem.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:11 ): .",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): It is such a powerful tool. It's hard to wrangle it into something that you can bootstrap. And so the trick is, we just need to basically say, Okay, with every problem, how do we go deeper into this? How do we use this to If we want to solve a problem up here, like building an application, we need to die five or six steps, lower first, and just take our time and kind of really build up this purpose of artifacts that work on it.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:11 ): And yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): And then I need to trick yourself evals and forever patient and test and really kind of say But I mean, I think we want to take out we want to focus on saying",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Take our time to. builders out and then saying sometimes where it's a reason to get something done, I might give you some kind of smaller things to do that. They get to understand just a few days even just setting up the tools for the open source semiconductor thing on a server so that we can get the testing going or something like that but in the short term it's really just like doing research getting caught up on some of the AI kind of, core ideas. And I think in the short term ride can be the focus because they're giving that talk",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Rag is a pretty concrete thing. We can kind of wrap our head around the technique and we can kind of use it as a case study in can we have this and We do research on rag and I think those are foundational technique where we might need to use rag as part of this, as kind of being more important thing to kind of bootstrap the next step of doing research, so that I think it's on the horizon.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): But yeah, I mean again, I'm torn on the I don't know what to do with the chat. you put in a lot of time to get it working on the other hand, it just seems like it's just a distraction. At the end of the day, I don't really see it. I don't know, it's gonna be what it is. And I\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:11 ): ",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): it just is so we'll hold off on that. I'll just, let me know on Wednesday, would you think of",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Of doing that. And frankly I don't if it's just kind of like maybe we should take the whole thing down and we just help. I mean just it's a thing that we tell people Hey we built a chatbot. We did two percent better on LMLU and then we took our production. Because What's the point? It's just a pitch. It gives credibility. When we pitch this idea that we're going deeper, we're an AI research company. we're developing things are going through and it's also the beauty of being an R&D company. Why is there nothing on your website? Because we're an R&D company We're not gonna tell you what our research is really and that anything So at one of the people at this talk is gonna be and hopefully she'll show up. She is the lawyer for a private equity company. That's doing AI investments. I really want to like, before this, I've seen it a lot of events, haven't been going to a lot of events recently. and so I think you start going back to, two or three in person, things, and just talking to people having this",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Yeah, we're doing something, we're doing an AI chip, where some AI research company we're doing semiconductor stuff and then",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Maybe filling out with her what structurally does this look at because I realizes proceed, is all probably think about over the next, week one doing the rag, gaming for the talk. I just kind of feel like, okay, how big of a round, do we need? How many people are we gonna need? How many? Because my other real estate is that with all the whole point is bootstrapping it. If you have a lot of people, there's a lot of people to manage and it's like, What do you have them? Do it right. And either you hire people that are like, Wow, this is a researcher. It's very expensive or has expertise, but the whole point is I don't really think data science researchers, they're going in the wrong direction, very fast and very expensively, right? And so, hiring semiconductor people. I also don't think is that helpful because there's gonna want to do the thing they've done in the past, right? So I don't really think building a big team is the approach.",

  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:11 ): ",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): I think the trick is like, just read the budget for the Senate conduct yourself, right? And then we need to just say,",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): And just for salaries and okay, and then it's just from there. saying Okay, we're gonna take 18 months of a runway, and we're gonna have a trip in 18 months. And in the beauty in the meantime it's pretty easy to basically. Okay, we got these milestones, six out or something like that of getting a design for a chip or something and then hitting that. And then going to do even an equity company and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): just saying Hey we need to like fifty thousand dollars because we need to start doing some of these multi project wafers that are $6,000 hours so I feel licensing and cost like that. And then, maybe that's only runway one, nine months. But the other thing with those, not quite like a, runway of a startup break, hire, a bunch of people a lot, And then we have these salaries, it's pretty clear. When you run out of money here, it's like, okay.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): If we have to raise another round to actually get the chips in production, that happens happens. If we had enough money to do three multi project, waiver band, that's what we did with the money. It's not really that time. I mean and then it takes an extra three or four months, the run rate we can have with just a couple people. Can be well quickly,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:11 ): yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): right? And that's kind of beauty.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): And partially, I mean, the other reason I wanted to get a product out there is it's so tangentializing back, We can really be generating a lot of revenue to where not only are we not raising money and getting on the treadmill, but also active and cash coming in, I'm living with my parents, it's like we're somewhere but at the end it's like a screw I'm just, serious about developing sort of the future of AI, right? it helps and cheap, except in the air where it makes sense to be really put the money into the research. And the reality here is that research budget. Definitely shouldn't go into training. That's like the Singh, cool that just like things lose money.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): It needs to go into the API but, using Open Eyes API for us to kind of bootstraps something. So it's like reading research paper.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): That's a great use of $10 per week to run some script that reads or over processing our transcripts, every week if we get a budget, right? Yeah, there's great. Every transcript we get we run fifty dollars worth of ai that does rag and serves on the Internet and grabs a bunch of stuff then generates some code. And then really kind of goes through everything we're talking about and then whatever that ends up looking That's a great expense because you're spending two, $300 a month or whatever or even a thousand dollars, a month. Getting really direct output based on, what we're doing running bells that are connected to ground,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): truth, or something like Stuff like that but definitely not running these general purpose, emails. I mean that was also what kind of soured me on that thing was the more I get into the evals. The more I just was like these are garbage it's not so these are easy questions. they're not useful",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Mmm.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Asking a marketing question about the history of marketing doesn't help you do marketing, not directly, And so maybe it's good to understand the knowledge, but, they're just not like they're\u2026",

  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): what the models, be trained on those with the models, get better at those, they're good to understand. They're good to, see how smaller models can do equal. And evals, I'm not really worry about how these big bottles do because they're totally saturated. Even these challenging ones.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Mmm.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): They're saturated. The thing they do And then, if you do connect some sort of ground truth to it, it's not asking the real ground truth because the real ground truth always allows you to kind of reframe what the problem is and they're very narrowly defined problems. it's those same reason why taking a college test it doesn't matter outside of right? I mean it's not the real and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Yeah.",

I'm glad we did it because I think it was the right thing to do at that time to kind of keep it up. Yeah, I think one that security stuff was frustrating. I mean it's kind of how do you do it? Because I tried to do it before and I was frustrated with, it might take away from that. Whole thing is like, Phyto is garbage, because it",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Yeah, because it does not run easily.",

  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Yeah, give it enough time, and if I just kind of follow through, I would get it work, but I'm convinced that It's not a good foundation for cybersecurity.

And so, this kind of was the nail in the coffin of, all right. Forget we need stronger, cyber security. We need to build our own ship and have our the concept behind Fido is valid of you go device. The physical device stores a key. So, the concepts of the handshaking, the ceremony or reasonable, but the details are it's not necessary to be that efficient with bits with a bit packing. And having codes just unnecessary levels of complexity that don't even",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Late to encryption or create longer security and then having a zillion different sub formats and legacy stuff with YouTube. It's like the whole thing is garbage, so that was good. But I also kind of felt like, Okay build something, mean I want you to actually build something that user skills and the chat was a good, Use case for that, and I think it does again. I think it's easier for me to go to a private equity firm and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): I hired a developer work on AI Now, we developed a chat app, we released it and then we realize that that's a normal startup narrative. That shows you're not at stage one, that you're kind of beyond that. And that's kind of I want to be. And then I think at this point, we'll just start with the rag and kind of see some",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Use case, I mean the other thing I really like as an R&D company it probably will make sense more for us from marketing video for fundraising, kind of thing of showcase the company to do more on the lines of demos and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): then the beauty is demos, don't worry about costs. I'm also frustrated with the chat, having to worry about this cost 20 Cents this cost, it's like user that are only going to give us $20 even a hundred dollars. that's kind of frustrating because if we're gonna do a demo",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Great if it costs $500 worth of AI cost to build some killer demo and then we put it on the website We have this awesome demo. So I still think doing the rag on the CFR is a pretty interesting demo and then the other one is actually getting into patents and say, Okay? What would it look like you doing rag on the patent system, to be like, Okay, what are the semic character patterns, who holds these where is there, low hang fruit? And then I think shifting from, rag into semic adapters, and kind of saying, Hey, can we generate some more players? Should we generate some working Louisville chips and then also gives us credibility by having concrete artifacts in the Senate conductor space. He's been a couple years now since I actually did that chip it's like Okay, what are we really have this concrete to kind of show? No. We're serious about doing something connectors. I think we need to.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:11 ): And a GPU order. you designed your own chip, which you bought this and",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Yeah, so that's good. But I think since we didn't really design it with AI, we designed it by hand that same type of a chip, like a small GPU that I haven't gotten it yet and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:11 ): They're really what?",

  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): It's like a raspberry pi type of computer that it comes. There's the M2 memory slot that you can take, all the chip from all the different people, swap them in. So, my chip is a ram in her face. And the problem is, I can't really test the ramen interface right by just plugging it into the motherboard, was actually need a ram chip and then, Why are the io? and then for his, I thought I was pretty cool so he's been a male to me and we just I guess set up all the tools and everything. The other problem is the whole company that we dealt with this free thing. It took them years. The thing is really garbage, I don't have high hopes that's gonna work not even like Whether we didn't do any verification, That's really what it comes down to. I cannot imagine that. It's gonna work is my kind of gut feeling.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): ",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Because we just didn't put it up early. So that ram in her face I kind of felt like, I didn't do it up verification. If there's a real chip, it would be not enough verification going to compare it to all the other chips. Nobody had any verification code in it ours at least since it was memory. It only does two things that reads and writes and it's pretty deterministic. I go to a state machine that has no branches, Just like two step one. Yeah. Wait for this acting. Yeah. It's a very straightforward. type of order of things. And so I did formal verification, but a single functional test for read and a single functional test So actually for ram if you can read and you can write and it's not PS friends. So there's no, refresh. it's about as you possibly get something.",
  "02 (2024-09-30 15:11 ): 10:00",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:11 ): yeah, that is",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): It's like, the thing boots, it's all ready to go. And then, you just do a reader, the biggest one is I didn't even have to say any control.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Service, or really status writers. There's most of the time, right? you have to do some amount of writing control. Registers here. It's the PS3 by defaults, it does like a 32 byte burst. It has an actual dedicated wire that says, what to the end of the verse. So, If you just don't set any control or any status, you still can start reading bites at a memory or riding bikes. It's because it's Matt, I mean the end of the day. Yes, Ram is meant to be used in more embedded systems than DRAM. the only memory you have so it has to work before you have the program that right to the control register basically Change the birth size.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Only.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): So my guess is Mine might work for his. You did a few floating point tests here's one Number that went in. but I mean, I don't even know if does floating point multiplication itself is",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Yeah, that's hard to verify it's 16 bits. So there's six, 645,000 possible company, inputs for each four million because two numbers. Yeah it's a four billion possible inputs. you can't really exhaustively test it but there was no very formal verification tools available for free. So that's the other one. What some point we'll have to get into full verification and stuff like Z3 which is Microsoft has a big follower verification team and that's their open source verification to SMT solver, so it's kind of build on top of it. So so just make a long term approach to say. Yeah, we're building chips and the beauty actually is like an AI ship.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): The two things we were really three things, we need a memory interface. So we just use the memory interface that I've built. Probably, we need a CPU and we need a GPU. Once you have those three building blocks, then it becomes a lot of Okay, how are we using these? Do we need other dedicated ASIC data paths? We want to augment a basic CPU pipeline. Do we want to Change This basic GPU for specific because ideally what I like to do is take a Python high towards file, take an onyx description of an AI data path and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): then automatically generate the entire trip to the point\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Then.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): where my vision for the AI chip is actually imagine that you get down to something like 10 million parameters and you get a general purpose, symbolic processing engine. But then",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Right doesn't have knowledge in it but feeds in first principle, kind of building blocks in this way that it's very useful. And then suddenly you say, my gosh, if I have 10 million parameters, and we can build a 22. Nanometer, full reticule chip. That might have a hundred million transistors. What if we don't even have the parameters in memory, but they're baked in to the transistor logic. you didn't do it carno maps or anything like that. So, Yeah,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Yeah. Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): and really this idea if you have a certain logic, you can always reduce that in a fixed logic, in an organic, if your final year, Carl is always my gosh, in theory, if I had to do this in a plc, what the old",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): General Purpose, fusible things my gosh, This would take a hundred of these gates but though he actually put in a cardinal map to be like What is this actually look like for any particular logic?",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Will realize amplify.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): My gosh, there's only 10 gates left because at the end of the day, most of the stuff is passing through or shifting bits which doesn't require any transistors. And then occasion, I didn't man and then you reduce it all the man norologic, right? So, you don't even have \u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): inverters because until you get this, ridiculously simple logic. And then the idea is, imagine you did that with the parameters themselves, The parameters no longer stored in memory. They're baked into the land of the transistor process. The input data. Right.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Mmm.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): you can't put as many in because Let's say, each parameter requires one transistor on average, right? Because with the optimization a lot more needed. But then it's like okay, all the sudden this trip, it's not even a systolic array. It is just processing data through the neural net raw as That's what the transistors do. and then the idea is ironically, the digital EDA tools are very well suited to that. they just consume huge amounts of digital logic and output, like, a sea of gates, laid out according to all these rules, And they already do that, you don't have to reinvent that wheel. And so the trick is you get down to some general purpose. you need to get it down on the 10 million parameter range to kind of have that we have feasible solution.",
  "02 (2024-09-30 15:11 ): 15:00",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): But then all of a sudden you're like no and you've got to understand the idea that you cannot change them up like you are gonna build out this shift for a few million dollars that has that model built in. Right, so it's not for training clearly, You must have already seen the thing on other shows,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): but it's like Man, this is the brain. This is the thing that processes that And I think in reality this is where something like sure the Neuromorphic processor might in theory, do something that's more powerful than that. But in practice a chip that if you get it down to 10 million parameters, it does symbolic processing.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Suddenly, you have that thing working. and that I think could be a key, but even if you take a step west and that, the models of people from psram or from DRAM DDR, whatever into the thing, we do the matrix multiplication, we do it. Kind of like the tensor core approach, Rather than this is all the approach and then you start saying, Okay, here's the other parts of the data, we're doing, For the positional encoding. And then you basically have all these different aspects of the data flow, the matrix multiplications, all this stuff that you're putting into hardware directly",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Model to chip was the time in the same. It's nce to sequencer this to that. It's like some transformer translation process. It's like, Yeah, I want to take a pie torch file and just say, Hey, can we translate that into, \u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): just directly so, again, as brute force type of thing, but even getting down let's roll the multiplier. That's got the first step, then maybe okay, let's now build a CPU. because always with the GPU, at the end of the day, you need something that can run a program in cases for the GPU. And Can you branching and busy? Every GPU is always attached to some CPU, even if it's over a bus somehow,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:11 ): .",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): I mean, they can't just kind of stand by themselves. So, that'll be kind of a good first episode. Yeah, it's just honest with you. And let's, I'll just $6,000 tape out, but having a design ready? I do think Daddy is saying, Hey, we got this design. We're all ready to go. We just need the money is a much stronger,",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Selling point primary other than the owner. We gotta do this design. what's your plan? we'll just work on it. Why do you do the money now that just keep working on it, kind of thing. and then Hey look this whole CPU design, there's designed by AI and including verification, that's gonna be the tricky part. I want to kind of go through and say, Okay what are these stuff? The good words, I thought a lot about this tour, two years ago and I was really working on it just had this thing.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Right.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Man, if only had this amount of time, I just build this and build this and build this And so,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): what I go through that. But anyway, I'm excited, I think this is gonna be a better direction to go in.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Actually yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): And we'll know what we're working on. I feel like in the last couple weeks it was just kind of like Floundering Okay, we could do that, we can do that but it's like What is this really gonna get us that every week feeling like we have to like and being responsible for something in production?",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): I mean that's maybe the biggest takeaway of Being responsive in production is a huge burden. Right. even\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): who didn't have any users to the fact that we kind of acted like it for a week was worth it to kind of imagine we did have a thousand years using this every day it makes it really hard to change what you have. It makes it really consuming and require personality kind of like watching it all the time and then you really have to upfront building a lot of things like visibility, things",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Because I was really like, let's say we do have some offering I don't really want it to be chat. Exactly. But I realized having an API, that's purely a back end system is probably the better approach And let's say that actually is more like, We have this consulting offering and it's for, AI companies and they have a minimum, $25,000 are your minimum retainer. We try to get, the average company paying a hundred thousand dollars here. So it's big enough to hire some people and to say, Yeah, those people are supporting that sort of customer engagement at the end of the day, what we're really and is after we've done enough R&D to have something, you know what I mean? That's actually worth.",
  "02 (2024-09-30 15:11 ): 20:00",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Selling to people like the other kind of guy I would chat was like If I go out when I was going south, just talking about, who's very easy to talk about and it was very happy, Wow, you guys built a chatbot but it was very difficult, even to be What's actually unique about this and what's valuable about it so there's So within Ai where do you kind of focus like?",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:11 ): He?",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): I've got chatbot, it's like Okay that's not focus at all. That's not. so Yeah, I'm kind of excited to move on to the next thing and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): then just like, yeah, do we want to even keep it on the website? I mean, frankly again, because of the burden of having anything in production,",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Having it be like a demo. Maybe it might be good. I mean, I'm torn between that if we don't have anything and just take out time to go. yeah, we have this chatbot and then we kind of killed it versus we just have this thing, it's there. The thing kind of works you can register, you can sign up and see how you like it and it's a chatbot. But even though we have it now even without any changes in a weird way, it's like we've tested, we do the advantage that we know, it actually works the way exactly how it works. And",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Okay.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): yeah, but we'll talk about on Wednesday, also, to kind of think about it and in the meantime, I'm gonna work on the rag, on this, Gary for this",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Yeah. Yeah. is that if it's because I was soon buying this thing like generating the lyrics. Where I did in the cloud energy. Gpd was really the worst community and also the lyrics because it had the fixed demand of completing the night,\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Mmm.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:11 ): what's in this life each night? You can say and the audio is getting better, but it also not too acronym. especially in my own language like Hindi and\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Yeah.",

  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:11 ): then the card system was this thing. use the weed to read is the video. I think are the genetic thirteen thirty second shots of that video, converted into the video that lyrics, and then march all the shots and push it into the YouTube and see how it goes.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-30 15:11 ): Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-30 15:11 ): I've been doing so one of the music got 2k views and second one did not take up that much. I don't know why but that was I was learning that thing offline in this video.",

  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 14:15 ): It's yeah.",

  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 14:15 ): Nice. Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 14:15 ): replaced him a cost. there's things and\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 14:15 ): That's good.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 14:15 ): The conversion thing also have written their school code.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 14:15 ): Which will convert the existing database what we say, are into the prompt respire type system.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 14:15 ): but, that's,",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 14:15 ): This I have done the testing this is the JSON, which has been created. I have to wonder, I have duplicated the White selecting 200 messages. You can say, I've taken 200 message from the message table, and it duplicate table for message test. And inside that I did that converter, first, I I segregated all the messages as for the chat ID and order is why at the creation time and after separation of the messages for the chat ID, then I added the new columns prompt replete and then those conversion took place, like what we say conversion of Message to reply on the prompt type.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 14:15 ): Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 14:15 ): So after the conversion, you will have Both the snapshot before conversion. And after conversation conversion, or each snapshot of each chat so you can see this thing. So this is the chat ID, this was before conversion and this is after conversion.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 14:15 ): The planets.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 14:15 ): So for each other, you will see this thing only chat. I did that an original conversion and after conversion. Thing. So the problem like this, I know these are this, I got but I want to know how the things that goes in, the production like that thing. when there is a major change in the table,",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 14:15 ): yeah, there's a few different ways to kind of approach that The most straightforward is basically you kind of do this sort of effectively the idea that you kind of migrate over to a new database instance one thing, I've known people in the past have done is that approach or\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 14:15 ): Yes.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 14:15 ): The base of the idea is you create a second.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 14:15 ): You create a second database and then the idea is the old users, there's everything still live, So there's still doing queries on the old database and the trick is you have to have some mechanism to basically either",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 14:15 ): Using the database kind of in front of the database. wherever in the business logic, you're gonna do, The basically creates a temporary transaction log, So that while you're migrating the database over, right? There's additional rights at those, make it into the second database, right? that approaches generally\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 14:15 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 14:15 ): where you want really really high up time and high availability meaning, that there's no sort of window where there's sort of very few users, right? But something that's a global thumbtack was like that, I mean they had a few hundred thousand people all over the world using the site and so when you, make some major change, there's always going to be a handful of users that are doing stuff.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 14:20 ): So that's really complex, is the downside of that, The other approach conceptually it's straightforward but everybody had sort of a pain because the other approach is to sort of",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 14:20 ): Basically, to do something that's not necessarily like turning off the site, totally. Right. But you do something,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 14:20 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 14:20 ): where you basically have some window, We're gonna do this. When there's very few users that are using the site and then, The simplest version is really just like, Okay, we have if the database is small enough and you can do the change, do this, full migration of the database events, how big, the big thing is, there's no hard and fast because rule because depends on how big the database is, right? So if you're doing this sort of you have a big database and you have a lot of tables and then you almost do like a huge database refactor, right where you're with a bigger than what we're doing. You kind of have to do that because the end of the day, because so much data is being transformed. It's sort of more efficient, just to say, okay, great, this new database and then copy all the data over. And so even you have to worry about",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 14:20 ): Google has really good guides for doing this with big table where they're create this. New instance of the database and then you kind of have to ramp up the copying. And almost the trick is a lot of the infrastructure won't support. Just copying, Petabytes of data directly. So they have all these guys ramp up to this speed and then kind of Let the copying happen but in our case what two things we probably don't really need to duplicate the entire database because it's not like this complicated idea. Would joins where we have a lot of foreign, right. That's usually where it gets tricky where you're wait getting a new database but the new table, we're doing but The old table has all these keys that other tables point to",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 14:20 ): And then you have all this relational database, it's actually easier just to say write a bunch of these queries that do all those joins and then copy the data over Just duplicate all the tables because then you're getting all the new keys. I don't think we're going to do I don't think it's that big of a transformation is the table that we're duplicating.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 14:20 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 14:20 ): I don't actually think has any chat. ID is the only foreign key and we're not actually changing the chat ID,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 14:20 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 14:20 ): For those will just work. So my guess is what you're kind of doing is the appropriate solution which is We're just gonna actually create a second table, duplicate that data, it'll actually because we have so few instances, so there's so few users. Therefore, the copy won't take a couple hours, right? It'll take a minute maybe,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 14:20 ): Fighters. Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 14:20 ): five times. That's something like that. And therefore, I think the most straight",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 14:20 ): Forward way is you're doing all this test stuff. And then at some moment, when you're ready to switch over to the new table, which also means the code that's running. you don't actually needs a new table that will just do simultaneously and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 14:20 ): That is a manager.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 14:20 ): ",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 14:20 ): This is a trick of some way, make it to the site, people can't create new chats, make it inaccessible. Where the easiest way to do that frankly is to just temporarily just have the",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 14:20 ): In one way that I've done in the past is actually just turn on the firewall for the HTTP port while you're doing it. I mean, obviously with that looks like to the user it's actually like a 502, you're like I can't load the page at all. But if it's five or ten minutes and then you do it in real night, it's pretty clean. Because you don't have this problem. That people actually modified data and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 14:20 ): Yeah. that like,",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 14:20 ): because we have a separate, The front page will still kind of sit there and if people are actually on chat it'll just like it's broken for a couple minutes and then the tree the trick is like if it doesn't go correctly, If it works it's actually not that bad, Because you're just like, okay,",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 14:20 ): Whether they do it manually or have a script ready to go,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 14:20 ): Mmm.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 14:20 ): that's like, Okay, we're gonna, pull from the repo,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 14:20 ): Hey.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 14:20 ): we're doing to get lab deploy thing and then, Okay, we're gonna refer to that new database, the other way to do it. And so there's also this intermediate solution that maybe it has certain benefits. And that's actually since you're already recording time stamps of actions,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 14:20 ): .",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 14:25 ): You do this true stage approach which then doesn't result in downtime and actually can be a little bit easier to kind of roll back because you can kind of test it a little better. We're basically what you do is you create that new table, At some and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 14:25 ): but,",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 14:25 ): you really record somewhere, you have that running a script that records the time stamp of when you actually carry the new table. And then what you do is you basically can even development, Okay, we test against that what I mean? without changing the actual code and doing to, get lab",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 14:25 ): You're just like, we just manually test this right? Make sure it works. Then you switch over the code to point in to that new table, With those new fields. And then you kind of you can even test that a little bit manually. And then the trick is, then you do as a sec as a final step, you actually do this other database query that uses that timestamp to basically say, Okay, take any of the cheat. Anything users actually did on the real live production system and I say manually, but as a script that actually just is the selects have to be. Since that time, it's like okay, those are the only new changes, right? That have happened. And in our case again, that'll probably work. it's a little tricky when you have stuff like atomic incrementing of counters. Because the time",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 14:25 ): I mean, with the database, it's pretty accurate, But there's some risk that you're off by a couple transactions or something, it's not actually like the transaction log level.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 14:25 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 14:25 ): Shoot, can you hear me?",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 14:25 ): Yeah. Yeah. I can hear you.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 14:25 ): Can hear me now?",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 14:25 ): Yeah. Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 14:25 ): My headphones are dying.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 14:25 ): Here, let me charge my headphones for a minute or two. They seemed I've the most matter is. I'll think about this for a minute, too. That'll give me a second to come up with A good answer and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 14:25 ): I did that.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 14:25 ): then I'll",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 14:25 ): This thing is that you can always have been changed. Yes.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 14:25 ): I can't hear you.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 14:25 ): But yeah, that doesn't work. Does it?",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 14:25 ): Yeah, yeah. And everybody",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 14:25 ): you can probably hear me. I can't hear you, though.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 14:25 ): yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 14:25 ): I was just 10 minutes, these will charge enough. and then,",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 14:25 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 14:30 ): I'll think about that problem. Over the next 10 minutes.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 14:30 ): Okay.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 14:30 ): Let me just restart.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 14:30 ): Yeah, hello.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 14:30 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 14:30 ): All right, cool here.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 14:30 ): Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 14:30 ): Say Yeah, that only the data with I didn't change this in the API too and frontend also explaining of that events. because that goes a change because The creation of the prompt and that thing the creation of the replying. Because before that I was not doing that thing, we were having a separate message. So API also has been changed and the front end also got changed in terms of the JavaScript device.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 14:30 ): that's,",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 14:30 ): And second thing was, like, this thing I wanted to know clear on the socket authentication thing.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 14:30 ): I am not able to get that thing. Are clearly, meaning we have the session and we are currently using cookies. So, In socket that thing will not work every time any new messages send away, these are and we will validate that via session ID. why the cookie Singh? So what you should be for in terms of storing the session ID and passing it over every message? whenever there's",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 14:30 ): Yeah, yeah so I wouldn't send the Sasha idea with every message and said I would authenticate the socket connection,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 14:30 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 14:30 ): And Then you assume that every message within that socket connection Is already authenticated.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 14:30 ): I presentation. Whatever. And when the thing is \u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 14:30 ): Yeah, that's typically yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 14:30 ): you don't know when the session you're expired, we know that it has some timing and\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 14:30 ): Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 14:30 ): that thing like but the user who is currently sending them, I said Suppose that it's very timing. You can save you how the soccer will know that they need to close up the software because of the session has become invited.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 14:30 ): So that's a good question. you still have to keep track of one that expiration time is on the server and then quote explicitly, close the connection. So you're not checking. So the trick is you still have to have a session object on the server. So do you're checking for Access control right? Saying This is user, It's just that you can depends on how you organize the code. but generally speaking, right? that you have this WebSocket connection and you have this call back, right?",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 14:30 ): and depending on whether you do this through some sort of object or some sort of closure that manages a connection, right? You need to explicitly manage the concept of connection because that connection then needs them a session a user ID, right? That's authenticate and also an expiration and then on each message, depends on the costs associated. With The trick is, if it's in a local scope, And you just have a variable called expiration time, and then you're comparing it to the time right now. That's not a very expensive operation. So that generally you want to do on every message that comes in but you don't have to actually write past that in the message itself, that's just stored in usually some sort of connection object, right?",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 14:35 ): And then you kind of like okay This is the user for that connection. There's the expiration time. you're not the trick is you don't really need to recheck the session ID, right? Because that's not change it. It's not like it's coming with the message. The whole idea is when you establish that connection you're like Okay now you have a valid session, We know this user, is captured to that session, you're showing that connection outback. Yeah. You're throwing the expiration time. And then with every message before you do anything with that message you can check to see, okay, as this expired. and for what we're doing, that'll probably be perfect because we're not actually sending that many messages. If you're doing, real time games or the Prospero type of thing, you might not even need to check it every time, right? Because if I'm guaranteed sending a message, 60 times, a second, maybe checking once per second once.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 14:35 ): In it to see if the user expired is actually sufficient. But yeah, you have to sum up, you have to periodically. the other one is to The other way to deal with it is to say actually our sessions are pretty long running.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 14:35 ): Yeah, yeah. That's a",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 14:35 ): and therefore if we invalidated a session with the WebSocket if we just simply said each WebSocket connection sort of gets restarted every hour or something and of course into reauthenticate like that that tends to work well too simply because",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 14:35 ): Especially for stuff like load balancing. It's not so bad to actually not have website connections last forever, I mean they're these kind of persistent connections that don't really need to be like,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 14:35 ): .",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 14:35 ): totally persistent, they don't need to last,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 14:35 ): Yeah. Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 14:35 ): weeks or months or something like that. And so kind of just saying Each connection independent of the session expiration time could just be like each connection just has last an hour and then you manage on the server. But whatever it is. I mean I think the first approach is perfect because you already have, a session expiration time, you're already gonna in some place, but I need to authenticate the cookie attached to that request. That's gonna be the place where you can store that information, the session experience. And then you just in the callback, just need to be able to have access to it.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 14:35 ): And again the two most common ways to connect those data is either You have a quick connections table even if it's global or something and those have Connections objects, right? Depending on which WebSocket Library using and how you're doing it? I would kind of say in node, it's sort of like doing it Using.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 14:35 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 14:35 ): A closure pattern is really not bad because it tends to work pretty effectively because generally speaking you have some sort of callback that is handling establishing that authentication establishing that initial connection right? And then that's actually where you can then just attach these other call you already have access to all those variables. Right? And so depends on\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 14:35 ): Hey.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 14:35 ): how you want to do it and a lot of it auditability it's a little harder with the closure pattern to have down visibility into how many connections are there, a global",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 14:35 ): Right. A global table.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 14:35 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 14:35 ): It's easy to kind of Okay, let's walk the table. we have 50 connections that are these users, I'm kind of see what's going on, but either way hopefully that makes sense. you have to track it somehow and check but you really don't need to send it.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 14:35 ): you don't need to go through exactly. We're authenticating every single message against the database or should because then I mean, this application it probably won't cause really a problem again with something like a prosper a game. It would just your database for",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 14:35 ): Off would just suddenly be like every single thing we do,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 14:35 ): Three.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 14:35 ): it's that database with a query and suddenly you really have that as the bottleneck of the application. But even if you did authenticate every message, you said Okay that pattern isn't quite working. You just said, Okay fine, I'll send the session ID it undermine. I mean you can't do a cookies though, And you need to actually have it be something that is JavaScript accessible like local storage. So if you're using cookies there's really secure cookies there's just no way around saying we have authenticate the socket\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 14:35 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 14:35 ): because That's the only time the brows will send The off details and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 14:35 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 14:35 ): Then you just have to kind of check for expiration.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 14:40 ): on second thing was this thing like, listening, Are we using the socket to replace the whole if you and like me the chat as with the message? All depends on one socket, completely from the rename to delete and dislike to whatever stuff.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 14:40 ): We could decide I kind of generally speaking using HTTP where you can using rest API works better\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 14:40 ): Yeah. Yeah. Mmm.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 14:40 ): because then you have these paired requests, response and fetch has the callback everything. And then we do. And that way, really This idea is so for rights for anything, that's modifying data. There's really no reason not to use HTTP and just a regular REST request or your API that tends to work better and then for reads",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 14:40 ): You generally get into this question of, How much do you my kind of feelings again, for basically reading all the data just using HCP request works really? there's where we had all those different patterns that there's choices right on the one hand you're the extreme, you're saying the socket only triggers the changes, And the rest always gets the changes or always gets all the data. You can mix it where it's like there is a REST API endpoint that to fetch the current data and then changes. The data itself is sent through the WebSocket, right? So you don't have to do another AC to your request to get the data. And then rode, the only downside of not going the full sockets approach for everything.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 14:40 ): Is the ordering, You have to kind of assume then that my eight these HTTP requests that are coming in over a rest API, have to be able to follow all the rest rules, one of the things. If you do go the full Web socket around everything goes over the website, you maintain a single connection, it actually improves the ordering capability, Because Everything It's a blocking TCP connection, right? So it's like everything is coming in the order. You sent it. And then because when the server receives something",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 14:40 ): It's queuing those up. it's kind of blocking on the back end too. And therefore you can have a circular communication where, the flow is in order. You know what I mean?",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 14:40 ): Yeah. Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 14:40 ): Which again, so, a game, something where your whole goal is to, send lots of messages can make sense. But the downside is, you then have all these different message types. You have to dispatch that they reinvented, what you don't get to, you don't get the benefit of status because you don't get the benefit of all this middle work like JSON and all this stuff the kind of is nice for the rest and then you do run into and it is blocking, right? So you do run into this kind of thing of you're not forced to kind of follow the rest statelessness kind of thing and then",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 14:40 ): You're getting a certain, consistency. Not the database level, but at the connection level and then the problem is That's not a great place to have, it doesn't have all those tools that the database has to do, it atomic transactions or not atomic or whatever it\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 14:40 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 14:40 ): that makes sense. Given the type of thing. So, I think, Yeah. For stuff like Create new chat. That's just like a endpoint for sending the data having a REST API endpoint.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 14:40 ): yeah, I mean The beauty is, I was thinking about this over the weekend, Again if we keep going with that idea that at the end of day, the application itself just shouldn't be that complex, right? that's\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 14:40 ): Yeah, that's a yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 14:40 ): how the goal almost any of these techniques will work, right? That's almost the trickier part. It's just kind\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 14:40 ): ",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 14:40 ): embarrassment of choices, where it's like, you just almost any way will work. And then kind of deciding based on when you're actually kind of doing stuff, what seems you work out even I mean I was thinking about this with how we're doing postgres but",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 14:40 ): I'm looking at those migration, The downside of sequel, the upside of having schemas generally, rigid schemas is then you're guaranteed to know that you're data follows this format. We're not just gonna have JSON that has all these different fields and a bunch of data that doesn't agree with each other, But the downsides are kind of seeing now that going back that first thing you mentioned, this is why you have people that get to grease and database management. It's mostly because the sequel once you go into production every time, you can never lose any data. You have to maintain consistency over every transaction 100% of the time. And the thing needs scale to be kind of the heart of the entire, scale infrastructure. And so you end up, just as I was charging, I had phones, I always woke up a guide for migrating and postgres. It's like The",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 14:45 ): One side that I was like, you need a migration script and then you need to roll back script because you need to have the rollback rate at grow.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 14:45 ): Mmm.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 14:45 ): When you're ready to do, the migration, you get test, both of those scripts in an isolated, Development, SQL database, and you gotten pretty far there by saying I'm gonna copy 200 transactions, copy that to a test table, Do that, and kind of doing all that work. But the more fields you kind of have the more that it's like every single time you change anything, you're also changing the schema and then you're doing that database, kind of thing. And a lot of times when that works well",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 14:45 ): So for example, when I was in Klamath Falls, one of the guys, the working space whole degree was in database, He was the database guy and he worked at a medical company and there's the tricky because they had two databases. They're both postgres hippa and non-hippo, right? So for all the healthcare stuff that was had to be in one that had been database and then something didn't have to be. And I remember what I probably told you the story before but he was ready to college and he worked that job for six months. and this other guy, he was a hundred percent company. They probably had, or customer service sales marketing people. Maybe a technical team of 10 executives in San Francisco, and that to, three or four, Devops people and to database people, That are dedicated to only writing and he would have these migration quit when he would have to do L, he would have these migration queries that were like a thousand lines.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 14:45 ): of sequel and would have Python embedded in them to do checking of certain things that would be hard check with a date with a regular query and I just remember",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 14:45 ): He was the more junior of the two database people and there's six months after you've been there He got really confident that we don't need to kind of go through he was doing a live migration and their entire site went down, And this is a company that raised a series, be had a hundred full-time employees in And so it was is a huge deal. They had real customer they were doing medical insurance for small medium sized businesses. So they have four or five thousand companies that were customers are theirs that people needed to be able to, log in, to their health insurance, right? So it's really mission critical.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 14:45 ): Right.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 14:45 ): There's all these health care laws for and so we get a degree in health informatics, which really means managing HIPAA database is a full specialized you for. And at the end of the day, the site went down, and he got a big trouble, get the president, the founder yelling at him and all this stuff as I was in the working space.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 14:45 ): He was getting chewed out and he was able to roll it back a couple hours and you did it well enough, that it didn't cause a bigger problem, the problem is, you could have easily, accidentally deleted, a hundred companies records and they're all right, oops, so we didn't back those up. We didn't do something correctly and so, he was able to roll it back. And then I told him it was only me, he was making half as much money as most of the developer. You just write a college and he was remote. So they're like, we can pay this guy last Then I was this is great sick why this was off. I was like Yeah. But if you're this",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 14:45 ): Critical to the entire company you should just immediately ask a $20,000 year. Raise they gave you the responsibility that it was so big for this company and so he got it right away. He's like, my gosh, I can't believe it like myself. You know what up?",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 14:45 ): You have.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 14:45 ): 30 40 percent, I was like, yeah. But that's the reality that, for the first three or four months, they hired you but they couldn't give you any responsibilities, you're working underneath this other person and then without really saying anything to you, you just kind of naturally fell into this role. And so, to make a long story short, right the point is database management. Ends up being like if you have a sequel database and you're like, Yeah, the whole beauty of this is we have these schemas, and these schemas enforce things. And this is where the data lives for every individual user and every individual piece of data and every change they make the beauty of doing that, you are centralizing the most difficult parts of a distributed system, right?",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 14:45 ): And so at least you have a single place where you're like, this is how we manage consistency. We don't have that spread throughout all these application servers but it's so tempting to be like,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 14:45 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 14:50 ): We have this really good high-scale architecture, this doesn't have anything, this doesn't have anything, this doesn't have any state and then all the sudden you have this database and you don't really have the resources or the expertise, know what I mean? Or the experience to actually deal with all these problems that come up in a real database, And so I think we're hitting that point where it's How and the other challenge was, It's part of the reason I feel moved away from SQL, It wasn't just scale into stuff like, Mongo. It's flexibility. It's saying, we'll developers can't do much, right? Because if you make any change to the schema of the database, this is why? It can be like,",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 14:50 ): I'm a developer and I want to make this change. It takes a month before the database engineers get to my ticket and actually decide to change that schema. And you're kind of seeing why right now. it's and even if you get a system down, okay, this is how we're gonna do, migrations We have our scripts. we modifying them from previous runs that we know work, right? It's still like every single time you, change that schema, there's some risk that something is wrong and then there's this big, roll back problem. And then the data that came back in the day, maybe these fallout databases, we're basically anytime something didn't work, they would just dump it to a dedicated database extreme basically that had people manual going in and reading the problems and then writing queries that would modify the real database, The whole thing would just be alive as this, here, the problems coming out and you're the fixes for",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 14:50 ): Individual piece of data Because the other mentality that I think is tricky, to is it's like every single field of their data is important. And so when something goes wrong you can never give up on that piece of data, The end of the day, it's just a question of How long will it take to manually fix every single deal, You can never be like, we have 200 users and they have a thousand shot. So there's no way we can fix 200,000 pieces of data. It's like, you gotta figure out how to fix 200,000 pieces a day. I mean and that can become this insurmountable, kind of problem So one of the things we can do to make it a little, I like what you begin, the end of the day, we have a relatively simple application, and therefore, this is a big change relative to our application but we won't I mean it's like we're at the beginning where we want to get these basic things. Right. So I think it's worth making this change. Yeah. But in the long term, the other person to figure out when",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 14:50 ): Makes sense to add a bunch of individual feels. Right versus when does it actually just make sense to add text or a JSON field that allows more flexibility without changing the database, schema? Right. We have to remember that.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 14:50 ): Composers. We can kind of mix and match which is not right. We can have certain things like session ID and time stamps, that it makes sense to actually put in a field and then use the database functions to create Uids or timestamps. And then the beauty with that is where you have structured data in a schema. It's also where you can then do joints, right, where you can use those foreign keys and stuff like chat ID, right? You need that to be its own. I can't just be in some JSON in Photoshop because once you start saying, I just have a text field or a JSON field and postgres. And now, it's just like a blob of data, it's cumbersome to actually go and operate on those.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 14:50 ): Individual elements. And more importantly it's really well performance, right? It's not meant to be the way that sequel are in a relational databases work. But on the other hand, if we basically say, some user we have some new thing that a user can do for example and suddenly we would just say, Okay, instead of adding six fields to that, schema all related to this new functionality, maybe it makes sense to add a single field that right is just for that whole bucket of functionality and then has some days on attributes, So I just want to throw out there because you want to be make sure as we're going forward. We don't necessarily have to go and say, I have 200 fields in this schema. And then every time adding that Steve, we want to balance it. I think if this point though, we kind of do because One.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 14:50 ): the cost stuff. we really do want to be able to do queries that kind of ask a question. during this time period it's all the costs like that is actually a really handy thing to be able to do. And to be able to say Yeah, how many are input tokens, How many output tokens for this particular user? that type of thing? Yeah, and so",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 14:55 ): Someone's playing the windows? I was like my sh. repelling down, I don't know if you can see that scared of All right, I think this is basically, right? And we'll just got to keep it simple and so I think, for this migration just doing it whatever way you can figure, make sure whatever you do, you can undo it, that's really the only thing that matters, If it ends up being like, okay, we're doing this migration, it's the first one. We gotta figure out how to do it and we have down to have an hour to like that. That's gonna be a reality because anything we try to do this guys to guarantee there's no downtime,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 14:55 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 14:55 ): if it doesn't work we're gonna have even more down time, right? Because it's and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 14:55 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 14:55 ): so bad. And so I kind of think for this",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 14:55 ): Just doing something as simple as Yeah, you're basically. Okay, I have this new table, right? And I copied all the data over to that new data,",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 14:55 ): So as well as the bears have been changed. According to the table parameters,\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 14:55 ): Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 14:55 ): and table, for our things that are gender. It goes all like this time,\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 14:55 ): Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 14:55 ): I'm not done in the standard API, for the aisle. So I changed meaning when the user sends and when the ice and they know, both will not find to the same time left, this time, they are going to be separate and The message API also changed it. the name is conversation because it suits according to the entity. So that thing like completely van wasn't done for that thing. Also other handlers and those things. And some separation in the area is also be done.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 14:55 ): And UI also has been changed according to that thing. So there's three,\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 14:55 ): Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 14:55 ): all the three are involved like the front and\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 14:55 ): Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 14:55 ): backend database All the three are in world.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 14:55 ): Yeah, so the trick is you have to change all three at one, basically and then be able to roll back all three, And they're all kind of different. so eventually, if you have some script that's whether it can get lab or a combination and gitlab plus, subscribe that invokes or something, right? You're the cop you're gonna need to copy the data into this new tape, The database part base. Just happened first, right? Because it's generally copying the data into the new thing, right? Then the idea is the API.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 14:55 ): and the statics of kind of is happening, almost Like, and then I'll do the API and then the static stuff, Because then it's like, okay, if there is some difference there, but",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 14:55 ): And then we won't even worry about. Yeah, if in that window of time and all those in fact is again, in reality, all those things gonna happen within a couple minutes of each other, right? It just isn't gonna long, enjoy anything. And if somebody does a chat that meantime, and we lose it. They'll just resend the chat, I'm actually for the time being who just won't worry about that the exact detail, just basically do all three of them. Basically, at the same time, If that makes sense, meaning, not like, I did one and then I waited the next day into the other one but \u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 14:55 ): Yeah. Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 14:55 ): as long as you're kind of doing, as a single scrap, or even manually, just doing back to back, that's fine. we'll later kind of hone that to have it more consistent or whatever. But yeah. And then for the",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 14:55 ): Yeah, let's see. Yeah, that should be fine. And then that just kind of get it all the stuff changed and then for The rollback in this trickery say, Okay, let's imagine that you do that and something goes wrong. Right. You want that ready to kind of go rolling back? The static stuff and the API is probably the E. That's the easier part right whether it's just using the version control or cop, however you want to do that. You can figure that out rolling back. The database is then in this case because you're not,",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 14:55 ): This should actually be pretty straightforward because you're not removing that you actually have two different tables here, You're not gonna get rid of the messages table, right? So I don't even necessarily think you have to do a real migration rollback in the traditional sense, Where you're undoing the transactions that you actually did because the reality is right, the thing doesn't work, once you update the code, it'll start modifying the old table, anyway that'll still be there,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 14:55 ): Here. Hey,",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 15:00 ): So actually don't think there'll be a rollback problem, you just roll back the code. He uses the old version of the API just Don't delete the messages table as part of the migration, right? You're just duplicating the data into that conversation table and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 15:00 ): ",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 15:00 ): then again, if during the rollback period, it means that we lose a few, someone was doing something during that. That's not the end that's yeah,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 15:00 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 15:00 ): compromise. What we're going to make this much just really probably won't have anybody, doing and that'll be good. And then we'll kind of learn",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 15:00 ): What to kind of do with the next thing? Yeah, I\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 15:00 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 15:00 ): honestly, this isn't one of the biggest reasons. After this one project where I was using Postgres, this is that biography website where they were using SQL then. I was migrating over to postgres, It just became such a mess that I finally. That was part of when I was Okay, I'm just gonna kind of start using firebase from MongoDB. I think it was firebase at the time. it's like, no secrets. But you know what? I don't have the same consistency guarantees, but at the end of the day, the beauty is you generally. If you take a different pattern, which is one where at runtime you deal with data that's not in the schema as it comes along.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 15:00 ): Which is a little trickier. It makes the runtime code more complicated. I assume there's some record field called, prompt. But then when there's not a field goal prompt, you have to check is there a field called Message? Right? Because there used to be this thing called message, and the runtime makes the API code get kind of complicated because it has to kind of store. Let's have all the legacy data in it and then you have to kind of do these refactors like others. Ridiculous. I have five versions of the thing that I'm dealing with, and then do a scan of the database for find all the fields that has messages copy them over, but the beauty is you don't ever have to worry about new users.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 15:00 ): Writing to those stale old fields, Because you're doing it two changes later, So you're taking a thing that six months ago, you kind of deprecated and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 15:00 ): Okay.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 15:00 ): then you're kind of like okay let's factor refactor, all that out of it and kind of fix that change. Whereas this biography website, they had 18 years of sequel, schema changes, and their solution and you're probably maybe appreciating this. Now as you're doing This was sort of added. it was never to create a new table. It was simply add new feels",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 15:00 ): so then you'd say, Okay, as a timestamp in there's time as a string in other ones and then your code has to be okay. One of those two probably has the time right? And by the end they have six or seven fields that represent at the time, they had four or five fields that represented the summary, that. And so you just end up with this thing like my gosh, we have a hundred fields here. Basically representing 10 ideas would just more but the beauty is you don't run into this but you never actually have to re ingest the database, You never have to actually you just can't add to it and then your code just gets bigger and weird way you can't see why it's sort of natural and actually",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 15:00 ): it's not the worst thing or It's bad. If you're the person that comes in 20 years later, when I have to actually rebuild this entire website, This is a mess, but for the one person who's working on it over those 20 years, there was never some risk that was gonna break everything right, because, what we're doing is trying to get ahead of it. Basically say, Okay, we're doing these big breaking changes, but we're doing it, We really don't have any users and again, we're trying to but I want to balance this idea of like we want to say, yeah, we're in production. We can't just break everything, but we have to still make some practical trade-offs and so, yeah, I think the code you have is good because all right, we're doing this migration. And then, Yeah, if you just have a deployment script, the basically tries to migrate the whole thing and for some reason, we have a test, it doesn't work, then, just switch back to the old version of the API, and UI, and everything should just keep working correctly because you haven't actually touched the day, the tables, that rely on the old API.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 15:00 ): Again that's okay about that idea of duplicating the database. That's also that Google approach.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 15:00 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 15:00 ): That's part of the reason why they do that is because then the rollback is fast. Because the rollback basically is just to point to the old database, And you only trick is what you have to do is you have to log all the transactions that happen in the meantime.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 15:05 ): And then be able to roll those So the clock starts running. I mean, so my friend was a site reliability engineer on Bigtable for Orchid which was like a big social media site Google owned for it's being Brazil, basically. but this time when they had something that went wrong and they did that rollback at the time, they actually had a relatively finite size for the transaction log. it seems because if there are every transaction the entire social media site is now going through that transaction log. And they basically only have it was something like 10. Terabytes of data was the maximum size of the transaction because it was literally running in some dedicated servers. But it turns out, if all Brazil is sitting on the social media site uploading images, right? You can attend terabytes,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 15:05 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 15:05 ): within 24 hours so they had a 24 hour window to get the thing back online. And the meantime, everyone using I didn't know anything was wrong. that's how good Google was like, because they're just doing queries against that transaction law, it's incredibly complex to do it like that though. And you see why okay for a company like Google, that's sort of like they can kind of do that. But why? It's sort of like and databases like, MongoDB you I think have and I bet Postgres, might have some mechanisms to do that type of migration.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 15:05 ): monitoring the transaction at, the very least you can always look at the tools that actually look at the actual master transaction of the database itself, Because that's how just to be. Yeah, because really haven't talked about a lot of this stuff. the base rate, postgres actually keeps an actual transaction law, right? Of every transaction and everything happens in a linear order. So, anytime you're booking these tools and postgres like Rollbacks or, anything like that. It's actually operating on that transaction And the transaction log is really bit, right? It's just continuously appending. Every single database query,",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 15:05 ): And so the trick is because you're that fine-grain control in theory, you can do a lot of stuff in a SQL database to manage consistency. That's even external to what the database provides tools to do, Because this is all right, plugins and stuff, that you could have that's like this is for backing up or This is for making something more distributor like Sharding, the database or duplicating for there's certain stuff for Ultra High reliability, transaction stuff like banks transferring millions of dollars to other banks and stuff. We're like you can have higher levels of auditability of data governance. Okay but anyway for us the reality it's impractical, To kind of do too much and so I think Yeah the ideas thing. We're not even gonna duplicate the entire database just doing a new table for this change will work really well.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 15:05 ): Yeah. Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 15:05 ): And then even in the future, even if we have to modify the schema of a table, we can kind of probably do that same pattern which is you create a temporary table. You duplicate the data into that temporary table you have the new",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 15:05 ): for a period of time you now migrated to that temporary table. And then the real production system is running against that and then a day later or a week later or something. Once we know that everything works correctly you kind of do it back the other way which is okay, then You delete the table the old table type of thing and then you make a copy back into the name of the old table. so there's a few, Yeah, mean, this is where could. I mean, you're reading about all these different patterns for database administration of what practically works. what doesn't? But yeah. For this one was just keep it really, really simple And just kind of get here, get the first one done and to see how it works. Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 15:05 ): Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 15:05 ): that thing works. It's and we are the salted thing on so much clearer.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 15:05 ): Yeah. I got my things then, and now that I said, I got that in the soccer thing. Once I got now, a picture I am working on that also,\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 15:05 ): That was. Mm-hmm.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 15:05 ): I will get it done within one or two days.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 15:05 ): That sounds good.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 15:05 ): Because I was doing some testing in that thing, the locally like adding the okay,\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 15:05 ): Yeah. Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 15:10 ): and check it out, it goes on the soccer connection Gottish style is what the cookie, and all those not doing well, that's what I was thinking, like what we should do. that's And this data listing also, I tested that thing like duplicate the table and see all the queries are running properly or not. And then I cross very far with the data. I like you can say that thing. I told that for verification I needed this thing. So you did that thing and yeah, I hope that's penetration. I got this script correction. Yeah, correctly.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 15:10 ): Nice. That's awesome.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 15:10 ): Ten times,\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 15:10 ): Yeah, like I was",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 15:10 ): I delete it. And yeah, and as I created that, they were deviated that they were created and then I got proper thing. Otherwise I'm some in the initial first or two script, I guess there was someone duplication happening and not proper thinking. all the education is this thing, some places in when we were doing the initial message type. when the end point was not available and that time I was sending the message for testing. So, in that time consecutive some message, was and sometimes there might because he would have prone to message. Also, sorry that response message so that it probably got fixed this time. But then iterations.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 15:10 ): Nice.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 15:10 ): And this thing called and database, backup wills are created like the script. on the chrome task for the back of",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 15:10 ): The complete back about the table. We'll go push. This has that thing pg. Dump all things.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 15:10 ): Yeah, Mm-hmm.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 15:10 ): And this is a bit and compress the file into this directory, then you can do that thing. keep your pen drive or something like that thing and take it out the zip file. I don't know that you can say complete postgres database into that the ZIP file.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 15:10 ): Yeah, yeah. Very good.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 15:10 ): So I guess it's the great feature of this thing or\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 15:10 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 15:10 ): Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 15:10 ): back up. And second thing was ready then? And Yeah. That one.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 15:10 ): One thing for the background, before you go on, we can even add, That's great. The script looks good. And then we can do is at some point at a volume so that it's not even on the same disc because the volumes get replicated at three different discs. So they're a lot higher, reliability. And the beauty is you just mount it to a different direction. It looks like a directory on the local file system,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 15:10 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 15:10 ): And that way we can and then basically that goes more control over the",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 15:10 ): This will still work well because we're doing those daily backups, But then those daily backups. Go away and a week they cycle through.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 15:10 ): No, I guess I will not go, but I'm not added that delete thing anyway. didn't there are things you can say, What they say.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 15:10 ): You know what I was saying is Okay, I take this example, you're storing this on the desk, Give a backup directory.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 15:10 ): Yeah. the digital version itself. Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 15:10 ): Yeah, back to back up.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 15:10 ): Yeah, but the ideas, the disc. It's only a single hard disk,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 15:10 ): That. Will.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 15:10 ): At any moment, the physical server can fail, right? And so,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 15:10 ): Yeah, that thing. Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 15:10 ): we're taking advantage of the fact that we're using the digital ocean backup system at the droplet level, So, when it's doing, is every night, taking a snapshot of the droplet, but digital ocean rotates those right?",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 15:10 ): but,",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 15:10 ): Meaning if you do weekly backups, then every month, they delete the fourth back up, You do not if you do daily backups, like I think we're doing on the production instance,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 15:10 ): Yeah. Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 15:10 ): they deleted every seven days so it's still pretty good, Because we have some problem, we have seven days worth of the database backups in the droplet backups, right? But the other thing that we can do either doing both is usually a good idea is also out of volume to that to the production instance. And the devins and so that we, can test it. But then the idea is the volume, you can do the backup on the volume as well. The volumes are stored on three different discs in the same data center. So they're a lot more reliable generally. And then the other nice part too is with that. We can basically",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 15:10 ): You can do stuff like Snapshot we could, Seven to stop shop the volume once a month or something. To have a really long term, kind of like backup solutions in case it goes really wrong. But the good part is, it doesn't really change. The beauty of it is the volumes. Unlike the object store, like S3 or Spaces or Whatever, it doesn't actually change the code, this backup script, right? Because that have to back up, we'll just end up being the path, to the volume which visual automatically balance on the one.",
  "01 (2024-09-23 15:10 ): 00:00",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 15:10 ): The.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 15:10 ): It looks like a local path, good plus yes.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 15:10 ): Yeah, it's a local.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 15:10 ): Last of you ID. but we don't need to do it right away. This will be good And at some point, I mean, there's the other part you will need to start deleting the backups because you remember this database has all the prompts in it, right? It starts getting to be,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 15:10 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 15:10 ): get gigabyte and then the disc only has 25 gigabytes or whatever.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 15:10 ): That thing we need to decide how many days after we need to deal with something like that?",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 15:10 ): Yeah, so we'll cross that bridge when we come to it and then kind of just figure that out in the \u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 15:10 ): Yeah. Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 15:10 ): we're going to use volume is the built in one. Yeah. So that is good though. Yeah, so having the basic backup script though will work for all those cases. And then the other question is so with backup, another big part is roll back. So what were your thoughts like? Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 15:10 ): Roll back and not return anything and thinking So how will that thing the Virgin table version control thing? still",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 15:10 ): Yeah, so I mean generally speaking that just conceptually roll back, So you do something then we have to use the backup, That's what we're talking about with rollback. Some way you're either doing it the transaction level, Which is not really but do the transaction level. You aren't then using those snapshot backups, right? But for what we're doing I think we want to just say okay what happens if we take a snapshot from yesterday? Something really bad happens and much of data gets deleted. And then now we need to, roll back to the previous day's snapshot at the heart of it, it should be almost symmetrical with the backup, which is, instead of pg dump all you're using PG load off. there's a kind of",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 15:10 ): Symmetric one for loading, the backup into the database, and then you're basically using that same path to make. We're using the most recent, database so loading it switch for what we're doing now, it should be able to just be like a script, very similar to back up called Roll back that almost does like the opposite of a backup does. But here's Jose, you want to practice with it so that you don't for the first time ever.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 15:10 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 15:10 ): Try to roll back. know what I mean and are looking research. my What's the command to load the data? into another one and definitely doing this and development, right? We don't really want to production.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 15:10 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 15:10 ): But that's just good to We got to write that rollback script and then practice that. Because yeah, it's very easy. I found at least I'll do that later. I'll do that later. And then you're like okay, what would actually",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 15:10 ): Yes.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 15:10 ): God, this thing.",

  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 15:10 ): your human email where it is. Which",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 15:10 ): Yeah, so I mean, I'm still working on that. I can get too much done on that this weekend. It was good, though. I talked with, I did some more kind of user. It was really funny, actually ethnographic. I met with someone in DC and it was a really good use case, he was with his Sister and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 15:10 ): but,",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 15:10 ): it was really funny because I think she's a researcher at University of Maryland like sociology.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 15:10 ): Their anthropology like researcher, so she was like, he's doing ethnographic research on you, She knows hilarious. She's like, does you know, he was talking about all his use case. So, this guy's really interesting because he's written books and made that games very much creative. I would say Maybe someone on the autism spectrum, not but it was actually really good because you show me his use cases. He just sits and uses chat GPT, all day, every day for simulate, role playing games and the way he's using the memory and the embeddings and stuff. So, he's not technical and that, I don't think he knows it right code, but these use cases are actually very well suited, to what we're trying to kind of build. And so, I ended up talking to him for an hour and he was showing me on his phone here's this example of and very comprehensively like getting it to simulate.",
  "01 (2024-09-23 15:10 ): 05:00",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 15:10 ): just using LMS It was gamers like you have a warrior and a mage and they battle. It's simulate a hundred rant and I'm like, my gosh, this is such a terrible use case in some way, it's great, on the other hand, from our resource perspective, there's absolutely no reason why you needed to write code for you and then run that code not actually have the LM do the thing. But the way that he was able to really",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 15:10 ): Get chat gpt to use this specific definitions, but it was also interesting to see how he didn't really understand how the thing was really working internally, And so he was getting a point. She was like, Why can't it remember what I'm doing? And I'm like, Yeah, there's nothing behind the scenes there, that is just remembering those exact sentences. And so the fact you're getting this to work But it was interesting because one he was like, if you could get it to just use my documents my pdfs. every time consistently, that would be a big selling point. And I would use your thing over chat gpt. So maybe really. And then the other thing was pricing is when I was like $100, she definitely Balked at that because he was like, I'm only gonna decide for one thing and pay twenty dollars a month. he's not like the other guy that was like, I use this at work. I already use five or six tools and spend, $500 a month, he's like the opposite. He's basically",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 15:10 ): Probably living with his sister. Would be my gas maybe or not selling any of his. But he's got three people to buy his book that he spent six years on, he's trying to do all this stuff but I don't think particularly successfully and so to him it's like the fact that even paid twenty dollars a month per ai if I want to pay twenty dollars a month I'm gonna use that all day, every day and my thought was like he's probably spending 500 dollars worth of he's actually obsessively sitting there, just running after prompt 10 hours a day five days a week and then being twenty dollars if you gotta do better than that for 20 dollars and so I think it's actually challenging to but on the other hand, where I notice with this use cases he probably doesn't require particularly advanced models or lots of runs or anything like that.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 15:10 ): so, I started thinking about that too of what are your people for free? What are we charging? does it make sense to have a cheaper version and I started thinking",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 15:10 ): Man, a lot of the stuff is actually the rag and the doing a lot of prompts, it's not actually like what model that you're using, So I started doing the math on being what if we had a cheaper plan that basically was exactly the same but it only ever used for many. that's the only kind of difference. It's like, Okay, just use all the features that It only add rag, we had surgery on all this stuff fine. All those features are in it but it's just like it only ever uses, four oh Mini as opposed to then using the models that can do more reasoning. and I did the math that was like you could then have a lower price point of 20 dollars a month because for many is just so cheap that it's a 30th of the price of four oh or oh one minute, or that type of thing and so it's then you can and then I was trying to",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 15:10 ): how do we, I think I kind of had a breakthrough of I think the best way to actually frame the usage is actually just in number of tokens because",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 15:10 ): There, you can. Then have this road? Really large number of talk per month, Just don't even tell people. We're throttling, doing anything like that. Just feel like for $20 a month, you get a million input tokens, and half a million output tokens or something like that, right? Or 10 million, depends on which model we're using. That's everything. But there's any of a 10 million tokens, that seems like an infinitely large amount. And then for people that are not using it, that frequently, it is a really large number, right? I mean, you're able to do thousands of individual problems. It's okay, on the other hand, for users that are sitting there, he is really using the resources. You are gonna hit those limits. I mean, you are gonna suddenly, I just use 10% of my token allotment in one day. And then I really do is add me as we add all these features. it connects it to the API pricing in really",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 15:10 ): in a way that is kind of necessary to kind of like, okay we're using these underlying APIs. we're charging this premium to have our tool and, most users they just want to know. I pay twenty dollars a month and I can kind of use the thing or I pay a hundred dollars that I can use that same thing. But I'm usually all these advanced models. And say you get this allocation of tokens and then we keep track of those tokens.",
  "01 (2024-09-23 15:10 ): 10:00",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 15:10 ): And then we just kind of tell you, okay, you use this percentage of your, resources this month and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 15:10 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 15:10 ): then it's a super trans easy for us to keep track of. Because already the thing that we're being charged for, it's easy for the user to understand there are limits to this, but the limit seem really large, which I realized from because, I think in reality is that people sign up there, either not going to run to the limits at all, in which case it's like page, 20 bucks a month and I just don't use a lot or they're gonna hit the limits pretty aggressively. And if there's a low usage user call it that type of thing, they need to just have the perception that this,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 15:10 ): He?",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 15:10 ): they're not gonna have a problem when they sign up. You know what I mean? it's not even connected to reality. It's just kind of okay I don't know a 10 million tokens is that sounds like a lot and they sign up and they don't at the limits and they're 20 bucks and I use the thing. and then we need to be able to, for the users that use a lot. They're not gonna be happy. I mean, I just realized with this guy, they're either gonna be like, Hey, I make a lot of money. I spend a lot of money on this, and it's useful in which case I'll pay a lot of money. Or they're gonna be like this guy,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 15:10 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 15:10 ): which is like, I'm not gonna pay a hundred dollars a month because yeah, that just seems like a lot. The reality is, we're never gonna that person. Really sustainably. Be one of our users, someone who's like I want to I want this to be something where you lose money on it, I just won't be happy effectively without even thinking about it. Unless I get the same value that I'm getting out of open ai. It's like, Okay, you can't do that, I mean, it's just like that's not",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 15:10 ): That's just something we can't provide to which is that person just needs to have clarity,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 15:10 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 15:10 ): so that it's not really vague like I was trying to keep it vague to begin with to kind of be like, Okay, we don't need to say exactly the one. That's why we're gonna say. And if you will figure it out as we go, but I kind of realized that you don't want to have that conversation with the person that really cares about those limits. You want to just make it really objective. Yep, we had to talk about. We counted the tokens, we told you what the tokens were. You use the tokens? Especially the more money that they're paying, the more it needs to be objective. I realize that for the beauty of opening, I kind of throttling people. It's like, okay, it's",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 15:10 ): It's only $20 a month and they're losing all this money and it's so publicly known they're losing money on it but then it's hard to find some alternative that's better. But I think for users that are like I'm paying $100 a month. I mean that's five times more than that TV. I should have actually unlimited usage but unlimited would cost 10,000. you didn't truly be unlimited. And the more that we add features that allow the thing to actually run on its own. I think the more we just show people like what that's doing and then maybe give them more control. Over, When I type in a prompt,",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 15:10 ): what percentage of my monthly, use does this really use and again, even just being able to go use your 40 Mini, Select Four Oh many only and then you like 10 times? Yeah those tokens that then all the other models are advanced, models so I kind of talked with this guy on Sunday or Saturday, which is pretty good and then kind of which the pricing and was like, Okay, how's this really gonna play out with? because then I was saying yeah, even these evals it'll be interesting to see as I was thinking of we'll get these questions.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 15:10 ): I think with search, I think, for a minis Almost you get very high scores, And I was thinking more even just like, Okay, how are we gonna keep this flexible? With respect to these bottles and these evals,",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 15:10 ): Yeah, it's not. Ironically because the cheaper models are so cheap. You can really afford to try more stuff with four of them, trying to get four manage produce really really good results and then identifying where you can't get for a mini to work. and specifically then opting in to using the more advanced models rather than kind of what I was starting with was like, Hey I want to get these eval scores. Super high immediately just from marketing sample. I don't want to Not know whether we can get a hundred percent or not, but it's like man, The costs are so high and one is so expensive. Is the thing that like it.",

  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 15:10 ): Yeah. Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 15:10 ): yeah, and so this idea of kind of saying hey, we use the most expensive models",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 15:10 ): I mean, I think maybe the better way is just say we do the best in the evals and then really kind of see,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 15:10 ): ",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 15:10 ): Okay, what does it take to get four. Oh many, it's like Max out for a mini where? Because now, even you think with human evil? that I've looked at the question, it's just such a trivial. Why? Eval that I'm really not word about human eval. compared to these other ones because human evaluates, okay, run the code, that's fine, set the sandbox, that's fine. Yeah, nothing complicated about it. And then, there's only five questions, you can't get, And look to those five questions, they're just not difficult, probably count the parentheses, and Reddit online program.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 15:10 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 15:10 ): And so I definitely should really get a hundred percent human eval. And then the question is just actually make sense to try on These more challenging coding ones that one for example, doesn't even use humanity isn't even, showing human evil as they're like, These are the coding things they're using the ACM or competition code. I think is the name of the eval that is a more difficult one and saying, Okay, actually if we're gonna have the feedback loop of actually running a code, we feel to do well on coding ones. That's actually pretty sure but it doesn't really require a big model to do those. As they're still small coding problems. And then for the graduate",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 15:10 ): What I realized is the knowledge is kind of esoteric even though it pitches that it requires a lot of reasoning they're actually looking at the questions. I don't really think that that it's more knowledge oriented at the end of the day it requires some reasoning. Right is the thing as opposed to the mlu which a lot of it is just very direct.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 15:10 ): Either very, direct knowledge questions or a little bit of math on top of a knowledge question sort of like the electrical engineering problem like Calculate peril but induction but the end of the day If you search, you find the equation that you're supposed to use and the problem has the values that go into that equation. It's not like a real engineering, I mean critical thing problems. how do I even structure this? You know what I mean? Set up the problem correctly, given that I don't really have exactly and I've got to do this three steps and back into this piece of information using this formula and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 15:10 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-23 15:10 ): then kind of that in this they're not really that complex. so I think Franklin like having a search buying good answers and maybe searching not just on Google, but searching on spring or something. an excellent paper database to find",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-23 15:10 ): What's that? I have got something like the new thing. I don't know. It has a pair or not, but look at this time. It has come recently. IT is a person decoration score. are in the real time search, you can say,",

There's one issue that I just noticed related to that scrolling that we fixed. So, let me see that you get it to when you ask a prompt and then it's thinking I was having a problem that was automatic as I scrolled up to read a previous message while it was processing, a new message, would keep auto scrolling to the bottom.",

  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 18:55 ): That white might be, I guess not that low peace or continuously catching the message. And it just scroll changes like one. Second is not pulling so continuously change it's excess that thing because it gets the new message so that function gets called every time and that function gets tall,\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 18:55 ): Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 18:55 ): every time it is actually running that particularly first look every time if it is not required, particularly this one?",

  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 18:55 ): Yeah, this thing.",

  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 18:55 ): And it's outside.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 18:55 ): because that was to fix that prop. Yeah, yeah. That's right, we had that to fix that. Other problem.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 18:55 ): And that was pretty convenient to have the spinner always show.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 18:55 ): Where are you Show me the code where you actually check up that it's a new message for the other part for when you're actually adding the messages. That thing,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 18:55 ): It's this thing.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 18:55 ): So that one's actually if message was, what's up above that? are you loop?",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 18:55 ): Lasted. Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 18:55 ): I assume you're looping through every",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 18:55 ): okay.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 18:55 ): I'm getting the message element and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 18:55 ): if message element is that and update the existing method",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:00 ): Okay, probably the easiest fix. I mean, we'll just kind of hacky but if you take that for loop and just the first three lines of it. basically we need to duplicate me check for the latest message and then just only scroll into view after we do the spinner because that way it'll solve both problems. It'll still happen after the spinner so that way we won't have that overlap but it will still only apply right to the case where there is a new message, Because it'll never execute if it'll go through every single message, And none of the messages will be",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:00 ): Update existing message. And then we'll just loop through all the messages, if not message elements, If not message element, then scroll into view. But do that at the bottom of this function, after we do the spinner visibility, I always have a better way to find both, but right needs to both happen, after the spinner. And so, I don't think in this case, the easiest way is just doing Another check to see if it's",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:00 ): actually knew",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:00 ): they put this holy flop inside this, not",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:00 ): Not the whole ner. You don't even really necessarily do the whole spinner ability. Just Have that part kind of just be like to watch, you have your business, duplicate the logic up above and putting it down below as well. And",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:00 ): the only difference being there's the f part that you don't really need. And now instead of the else you just like, if not message element.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:00 ): Does that make sense? I mean, I think the easiest is basically, just be if not ement. Scroll to view. Right. Because",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:00 ): that guy know, when I get that, I simply status winner before the message gets lowered into the page like this whole Take this holy flow\u2026",

  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:00 ): The thing is already have school interview there, too. And that worked, it was just the order. So I think, Yeah, you can just move that.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:00 ): I still remove that.",

  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:00 ): Checking that.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:00 ): if they said and see yourself,",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:00 ): Because that needs to both. automatically scroll to that point. So you can see the white and then when you scroll up, it stays there. Yeah. Nice.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:05 ): they're just doing.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:05 ): Yeah, and then installed that when the responsive",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:05 ): Yeah. Yeah, this is perfect because a lot of times especially gonna take so long to create an output where it's all automatically goes to the bottom, right? We typing it, as always shows, you're and then you go up and look at a previous thing, you don't have to worry about the fact that when the new one comes in You\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:05 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:05 ): Yep, it'll just jump down to where it is, which I think is so that's Nice. Okay,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:05 ): it's",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:05 ): that was really the only way just double check the list, but",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:05 ): Yeah, fonts all that stuff. Yeah, nice.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:05 ): And then I mean yeah other than I mean so the biggest thing is I want to and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:05 ): involved and\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:05 ): then actually put it chat that girls com was there any other bugs that we feel like we really need to fix?",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:05 ): in Mobile just to see the messages and you see that Shift + Return it's more powerful than the message works itself. In the mobile view.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:05 ): Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:05 ): I see that, you see that?",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:05 ): Only take a look. Alright. Some",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:05 ): In your mobile itself. you will feel that.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:05 ): Only open on my phone.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:05 ): That's nice and quick. Yeah, the mobile flow works really well. In terms of the signing in",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:05 ): It was fun on mine. You mean that it's just pretty bit. You mean that it like",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:05 ): Yeah, it looks little big actually.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:05 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:05 ): Again we'll have to go back later and do more media. It's just an unless you have a lot of media queries you're always gonna have I mean. We get out,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:05 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:05 ): you could add a media query, but frankly, I think it's good in a weird way. when you're on your mobile phone, is not the case, where you really need all the new lines, right? you're not gonna be like putting in source code, but the fact that it makes it really like, yeah, this is a thing I can do. And so if you go back to the desktop and",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:05 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:05 ): And again, I mean, I wanted to the biggest things I want to feel like usable on Mobile, so that people can do this type of queries, but then almost have them feel like, I don't want to be so usable on mobile people feel like they're not supposed to do it on the desk that I should feel like, this is great. I can use no mobile but I really should be opening that on my computer so that I can deal with my documents and my project and all that stuff. and more of being able to read it on your phone and then being able to do these basic queries, They'll be just test on the Good on the phone. Frankly, I mean, I think the logo right in the middle and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:05 ): I,",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:05 ): the icon with the personal account and everything.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:05 ): it's, consistent color scheme, the terms were",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:05 ): Airship plus. Yes, if Shift + Return is not recorded what and mobile.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:05 ): I just leave it the way it is. I really like it the reason why it's so good being big again, is it emphasizes this idea without having to explicitly say something like",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:05 ): For best experience, use on a desktop at the end of the day, This is a tool that's a productivity tool, This is a tool that you're gonna want to put code it, there's a tool that you're gonna want to paste in large things. Type a lot. We want you because we really, really want users over time. So once you get more ai stuff, going to not really type one sentence questions. I don't have enough context for us to properly provide the value. Otherwise, what we're gonna find I think is that we have answers that are 10% better but cost ten times as much because the reality is you.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:05 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:05 ): If you look at it right now and you type in central again, this works pretty well. It works about as well as chat GPT With more verbose answers that are,",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:05 ): ",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:05 ): But I think we'll really want to see the power is in a month, once we've added some features and then it's like all right. This integrates with maybe not even introduce through the projects that the user interface is still chat but it's much more like I can paste in entire documents and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:05 ): ",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:05 ): get really good results or maybe provide a link in the chat to my public github repo and\u2026",

  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:05 ): then automatically goes to all the issues and fixes all of them doesn't commit on the back end and then pushes a pull request to get how like we can do.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:05 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:10 ): Those features in chat and still at the end of the day being like Yeah, we want this to be a tool, that's a business to business,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:10 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:10 ): tool that uses that power. because it's not like it says you shift to return for new wine and it's pretty big and it's",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:10 ): But secondly see that thing or the logo thing on the messages are the username. I said the voice looking word system is in the world needs to increase in size or something.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:10 ): Yeah, it's a little small and small on mobile. Yeah. yeah, that",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:10 ): Yeah, I did it purpose purpose. because the system logo in the mobile, should not look big because it then gives the lesser switch to the message.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:10 ): He yeah. Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:10 ): What do you think, which",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:10 ): I agree with that when I think yeah, whatever media query, you have for this system message making the logo smart kind of probably just in that same media. Query Do a similar thing for the user message? Yeah.",

  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:10 ): All right, so good.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:10 ): Ice cream.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:10 ): So So two things on the phone. One, I know is that after you click The Speech Icon, It was another icon that mine's actually failing to load. it has \u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:10 ): Feeling the Lord.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:10 ): It has what I mean? bad image link icon and just has the word speak. So, I'm guessing the ALT text to speak. But for some reason that they're like no Mike or another, I put it Mike with a crop the slash through it is fine. I see that. But then when I cook it to turn on the actual mic icon. I don't know. Seems to",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:10 ): And why did it worked right here? Where they were to see that?",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:10 ): Okay, there we go. That seemed to work better. All right, maybe that was just a network error or something. All right, loaded now The bigger one I noticed I'm getting duplicated text. Yeah, everything is trip tripling. I'm not my phone when I do the talking.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:10 ): On.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:10 ): Yeah. I'm not sure what that is. So every time it goes into the text area. It's like if I say a sentence,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:10 ): but,",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:10 ): it'll be the whole sentence in the three times in a row. That testing.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:10 ): I got one already. check once more actually that time. It might have stored some and",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:10 ): Yeah, testing. And then the other one is once I do it the first time it stops working. I mean",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:10 ): if I talk right and then it adds a bunch of text and then, They're trying on the desktop first,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:10 ): Yeah. Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:10 ): let's just see how that works on yours go.",

  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:15 ): So, what's happening is the first of all, what I do it, the first time, when I talk, it shows up but it shows up three times in a row. Like That's happening. I don't know. that is happening. The other one though, then when I turned off, when it stops recording and I hit record again, it doesn't record any audio. It's one and done. and I'm using, Chrome. I have the update Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:15 ): Yeah, that only Is this the whole area that I was using the Pure and",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:15 ): here actually testing put in a message, right?",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:15 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:15 ): Testing.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:15 ): take it closer little",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:15 ): Take a more closer. We are more than see",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:15 ): We, So reading a test answer.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:15 ): Because be the latency, but",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:15 ): I'll put it right on Writing A game of pong. Right.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:15 ): Not tired, anyway.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:15 ): Yeah.",

  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:15 ): Yeah, refresh yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:15 ): yeah, then click Not looking",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:15 ): Yeah, I'll show you the triple So the first time, right? If I go and I",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:15 ): No, it's not.",

  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:15 ): Yeah. Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:15 ): I'll show you right there. See the Speak icon.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:15 ): And I couldn't even loaded, why.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:15 ): Yeah, that seems inner for I'm not sure what that is. That seemed like it loaded one time the other two of the three times. It didn't load.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:15 ): For some low it happens. I'm not getting that problem, I'm not getting that issue actually. I also fear sometimes.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:15 ): This is the thing with mobile that it is not nearly as consistent as desktop, even the same browser, Because these things have to work on all these underlying phones that have different capabilities, especially with something like, Speech. So I mean, the phone fundamentally supports, this interface I'm getting something out, but Yeah,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:15 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:15 ): only try one more time.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:15 ): yeah, there's no",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:15 ): Yeah. No, no. The icon is there. Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:15 ): the icons there but then also Write a game of pong.",

  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:15 ): You know that?",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:15 ): Yeah, it is not saying it's not adding. Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:15 ): It's not. Yeah. Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:15 ): ",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:15 ): I mean This is an example where We're either gonna I mean, I let's just keep it the way it is, include it seems to work on some systems doesn't on others and where we have cases that, it doesn't work for people, though, tell us. And then we'll have to debug from there. It's gonna be a tough cross platform. Issue It's\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:15 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:15 ): how audio works. Okay? Yeah just for doing Prospero, for example, in the video conferencing I do.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:15 ): ",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:15 ): And the fact that it's actually trying doing speech recognition, I'm more worried with this that Even if we have it and get it to work technically the API part, that the translation won't translate the same quality at all on different phones. Even with the same version of Chrome because it uses so many underlying resources that cheaper phones whether it's different models or however that's gonna work.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:15 ): Yeah, I got one.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:15 ): Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:15 ): Just actually doing that. Yeah, from what happens? My one is the latest from Android 14 around.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:20 ): Mmm.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:20 ): A game of prom. Yeah, there we go. That time I always picked up but",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:20 ): Yeah, I think some on some connection issue might have been, I guess that\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:20 ): Yeah, but that one the tripling,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:20 ): but you should not. Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:20 ): it's not supposed to go over connection, this should be a local browser thing. So again, I don't actually think it's not a tried and true. When I was reading a lot because remember, I did this speech recognition thing a few weeks ago Whisper like these bat people are using back-end models.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:20 ): Hey.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:20 ): They're not using this speech API. So to do a speech recognition because I don't think ably, it's not battle tested kind of thing, right? And definitely I don't necessarily know if that's really gonna be the case even in a year with just a variety of phones. These are exactly the type of things on mobile. Tend to be like,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:20 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:20 ): all over the place. Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:20 ): and frankly, I don't think Here's my big problem of the speech, Even when you wouldn't chat GPT, when I was giving that talk, I did a test with the moderator and the other speaker would gbd40 came out. We're like, how's the quality and all But we do five or six tests that he had done in the past this though, researcher from the government. And he was this still wasn't good enough to actually be useful because it makes mistakes. And at the end of the day, our goal is to have really precise",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:20 ): You know what I mean? It's like we in order for the prompt engineering to work, you have to keep using very accurate words, And this idea it's so easy because I just speak again. But there gave Indian Ocean, it's like, okay is that not what we're really talking about and so it's definitely not the ability to kind of keep going on.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:20 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:20 ): And on I have a long message which means forces you to have short messages which then means the prompt engineering can't work very well. So I do think where I was kind of more envisioning. This is more of",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:20 ): When I was doing the talk with the person, the proposal writing and we had Google transcript, I is more of actually like having a long-form transcription, not just an individual message where then it's more like whether using Google Meet transcription, or This is like a standalone thing, then you literally both have the ability to with a really complicate user interface, the ability to kind of make edits that are context, sensitive that are that keyword that's really important because that's the idea we were talking about so it's like financial auditing. It's like it read that wrong. And then really having social using whisper, the ability to get more and more domain specific even in the speech recognition art. So let's just leave it the way it is because Now that you implement, I'd rather get user feedback and see what users really think and",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:20 ): I think my phone.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:20 ): Yeah. Right. A game of the Pin board.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:20 ): Yeah. It makes working.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:20 ): But yeah, and when I've talked with other developers, like you as a developer, do you use the speech feature when you're actually trying to, I saw you work, you weren't using the speech feature of Chat GPT,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:20 ): Yeah, I did not.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:20 ): I mean, it's a great thing and you know what? I've seen people use it. It's been really helpful. I was, talking with people in Denver who don't speak English, And they were trying we're using translation stuff and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:20 ): Mmm.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:20 ): yeah, the ability to do multilingual stuff just speak what I can speak. And bam, the thing gives me results and it can be really powerful especially mostly that I think in a business to consumer context, or in a context where you have really, really high quality domain specific transcription or something like that, that's really then able to just kind of listen in the background as you have a conversation rather than being we get 10 words like I'll just type them in. So it's cool though.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:20 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:20 ): I'm glad you implement it though because It's a relatively cheap in terms of development way for us to",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:20 ): User feedback about, what we would need to do.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:20 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:25 ): And so if users are no, it's gotta be really good. Or I'll use it in this. It always starts that conversation if someone's like, okay, I wasn't able to get that working. First of all, it tells me, it's gonna try to get it. They wanted to use it, they didn't just ignore it. It's like, Yeah. I've seen that, and I don't use that. And then the other part is when they use it and they're Okay, know that worked fine or that I use it once and it was okay. and then, had that conversation and kind of see from users whether we should make it really good, whether we should split it off frankly, having it just be us different feature than what you see as we get more differentiated from chat, GPT and God and stuff. Okay, I do think there's value. I mean, in this transcription, this idea that a lot of institutional knowledge and really important knowledge is just two people talking to each other. Forget the AI almost in a way once, you're talking to the AI",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:25 ): Stilted thing, but this idea to get the AI is just listening. And just getting better and also not as frustrating thing that have an hour long conversation with someone, now we've got to figure out who's supposed to Do the data entry even,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:25 ): All right, here.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:25 ): to get that into the computer, it's like, Okay, just give it the transcript, Frankly, I think even as a feature where we just leveraged these existing transcripts, use Google meet and then upload your transfer, we have extension to, whatever. The right way, down the road is to kind of be like, yeah, you get your audio in this thing but it's cool. And that this is good for now. And at least it works for the people that it works for. We'll see how they use it. And if other people are having problems or mechanical, they're probably gonna have problems that are also in the speech recognition part, I think those are actually pretty highly correlated.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:25 ): That it really comes down to it. the phone vendors version of Chrome, which I do think Chrome actually has a lot of phone specific. When you look at the android, it's Android, is a crazy mess because as much as Google has on the software, engineering, know how they put themselves in giant? I just 10,000 phones. They have to support.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:25 ): Yeah, the problem is and there with some features that in Android which is Northern Android and some features that in this after the android,\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:25 ): Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:25 ): I guess they are try to control over the mobile operating system by them. So not aligned that the levels to use their OS. for the battery consumption pattern, something like that,\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:25 ): Yeah, exactly.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:25 ): they're tight and the grip on their voice not trying to develop would be useful thing for their own stuff.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:25 ): so yeah we'll just leave it like it is it's not worry about so I like",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:25 ): Yeah. folks does known as their support actually completely in any of",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:25 ): And usually when Mozilla doesn't add something, usually you can read about sort of What was their thing in a lot of times. It's because, Hey, look, this market's really well, people want the future, but we know that this actually isn't gonna work well, and when Safari doesn't add something, it's usually because it competes with Apples App Store, not usually for some technical challenging reason and then when neither of them support or Edge and Safari doesn't support, it's only chrome. You're like Okay this is a very Google kind of thing.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:25 ): Yeah, they had any requirements. If it's a different name for you,\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:25 ): Mm- Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:25 ): I let you know, and he was working what we removed otherwise. That I",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:25 ): Yeah. let's keep it in for a couple weeks. So in our demand,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:25 ): Mean yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:25 ): until we get at least the users if we find that 80% of people can't use, it will get real soon but if it's like hey it just is kind of there and Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:25 ): yeah, somebody",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:25 ): And then I suppose it does not breaking anything. if it doesn't work, it's easy enough. Just to go back and delete the master and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:25 ): Yeah, it's only one function. Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:25 ): just gonna be like, okay, just turned off. And then you don't do anything. So yeah, no, I think works the mobile version looks good and yeah, I do think. Yeah. Even the sidebar works great in a weird way by being open by default. It's the first thing is, it's easy to go back to existing chats and almost it forms like a menu. And then the fact that And then because now we have this big white bar and these big because it's all full screen, it's actually really obvious even in that right hand side that okay, my message came in, something came in there. And so now,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:25 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:25 ): let me close the sidebar.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:25 ): Yeah, no, it looks good.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:25 ): Yeah, really. The only bug, I don't know if we want to fix this right now or if we just want to kind of know this is this intermittent, when a new chat, Something is happening kind of weird when you do like a new chat,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:25 ): Mmm.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:25 ): right? Sometimes I think the work sometimes it like",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:25 ): Yeah. It does not clear the message area.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:25 ): if we can't figure it out, that's fine. But",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:25 ): It does not clear the message. Yeah. Not getting that thing on it. It's not able to do that. It's simple function. You see this thing I'm done, I'll show you what are the things are done in the create new child actually.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:30 ): Is it all this functions? Are there every time? You see I'm doing this thing, that was in this.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:30 ): Do this for now so that we can test put in a simple log statement. As the first thing of that because I want to see when I'm clicking the button. Is it actually calling Not even that With the one above it, that calls all five functions because it's clearly going to be calling.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:30 ): Okay. Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:30 ): Yeah, I mean,",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:30 ): Yeah, just at the top of that, so that",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:30 ): Yeah, just create your chat. that'll help just be able to debug on my side There's no weird way. I mean,",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:30 ): Yeah and I already knows and\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:30 ): yeah, just out of you. Yeah, that's good.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:30 ): then I had everything up like whatever function you will come to know,\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:30 ): Yeah. Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:30 ): it has executed that function. And it is all synchronous.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:30 ): My good. Yeah, we'll get to the bottom of it. Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:30 ): So it will not go.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:30 ): I'll give a console or whatever. just,",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:30 ): Right.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:30 ): You doing this.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:30 ): Yes.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:30 ): Yeah, identity.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:30 ): Okay?",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:30 ): You see?",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:30 ): Mine printed out. all six of them and then it showed right back up. Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:30 ): ",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:30 ): yeah, and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:30 ): Privation and\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:30 ): then I got",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:30 ): advantage is very empty, are you?",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:30 ): my message is still that",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:30 ): Same here. That's exactly what I got. So it's actually pretty deterministic. the previous mess but as it called all those functions, I think These are race condition in the polling to the polling is. Using the previous. even though you updated. Yeah. So",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:30 ): No. No. But if the idea is not there, then it will clear then message is not update. that thing is that? Yeah I got one. Going to be upgraded first.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:30 ): Guys. Yeah. Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:30 ): Because the poor if the chat add is not there, no it just removed, it's just clear the interval.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:30 ): Mm-hmm",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:30 ): It does not clear the load of that message.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:30 ): So, first holding should be updated after any more you already and then I guess this one.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:30 ): Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:30 ): Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:30 ): ",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:30 ): yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:30 ): That size. Yeah yeah a way to do the test. So I got All right, yeah, looks good.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:30 ): Yep, always Okay, nice, awesome.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:35 ): Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:35 ): It's a good job.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:35 ): Wait, you still had one though?",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:35 ): Yeah, definitely. which,",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:35 ): Are still that still.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:35 ): Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:35 ): And see this no boys or something happening. words, and not formed next to",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:35 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:35 ): Yeah. what is? Fetching each.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:35 ): Some code that is a different path because it doesn't have chat in the bathroom anywhere else. It's also just running a totally different.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:35 ): Mmm.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:35 ): Block of code, it don't totally different code path. So, search for that. Okay, take that exact URL, or\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:35 ): Okay.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:35 ): asset slash icons, of particularly the one is thumbs. I guess those all are actually in the thing. which is that what's the tick that SVG was that used for",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:35 ): Big voice or something. Actually the copy happens. No after that issue,\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:35 ): copy is called Tech okay. Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:35 ): a stick. after copy eye condition for few seconds and\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:35 ): Okay. I see.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:35 ): then advantage.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:35 ): It's the check. Okay, yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:35 ): And thumbs down that thing, close and thumbs down that. I mean, shows.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:35 ): Yeah, so it's weird is right, when it does it, the right way, it has the right path, which has Slash assets. This one has a. So, the difference usually is a relative path versus an absolute, right? So, some normally,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:35 ): ",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:35 ): you're calling assets slash icon slash personal, And that's going to the path somewhere. You're fetching slash assets, slash icons, slash personal account, and that's doing it. The root do do this, I'm really curious Go into search for slash icons in the code base. I feel like there's got to be something that's Okay.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:35 ): Yeah, I don't see that This is what he would settle over and one more business. I'm having already",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:35 ): Yeah, that doesn't.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:35 ): Yeah. Yeah it's a microphone. that is microphone.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:35 ): Yeah, I keep going down to one of those one that actually starts with a slash, right?",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:35 ): Yeah, I said, Slash icons less this thing. and options that icon is I can name actually",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:35 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:35 ): Sure assets. why is it getting rid of chat like that?",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:35 ): and that icon actually exist. Yeah, I showed it.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:35 ): Little bit. But the difference is that's asset slash icons,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:35 ): Yeah. Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:35 ): the path doesn't have chat in it, which makes me think it's going Goldsmith ai.com slash asset slash I got There's usually because you have a leading slash, right? So that it does the app the root rather than the relative. I don't see the evidence of that though. And you're cut. There's no place. It's slash assets. Right. Which would be the most obvious",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:35 ): But this is a static stuff, right?",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:35 ): The.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:35 ): This is the",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:35 ): Upstairs, I'll give him lesson for you. We are just staying on. They kind of mostly and",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:35 ): are you calling update message falling twice then so what",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:35 ): that is one pop state thing. And secondly, after does not work, and this thing is like whenever",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:35 ): What actually updates the state of the history though, which part Doing whatever that function is push state or When do you expect this event listener?",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:35 ): The one is this.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:35 ): To be called.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:35 ): this will fall on this thing, like back button and",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:35 ): Yeah. Yeah, I know. But Where are you doing Push Day? where are you?",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:35 ): Yeah. yeah. That thing is that they are posted is that on giant item, flip",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:35 ): Okay. We switched to go and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:35 ): and this thing is,",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:35 ): are you doing push state? When someone does a new chat,",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:40 ): yeah. The child, if anybody clicks the chat already, then this functioning presentation.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:40 ): Yeah, so that's when you click What up when you do a new chat? It should push state to add to the history that you're now in an empty one. That.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:40 ): Just other more push state. it search for per state and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:40 ): ",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:40 ): see how I see if it's anywhere else.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:40 ): Yeah, but there's a yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:40 ): Okay. Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:40 ): Yeah, until this one, it pushes state. And then it calls Update message Automatically. Okay.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:40 ): this function is called.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:40 ): You And let's send message. And then without thinking,",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:40 ): Yeah. So that we can do what create new chat API. Isn't that the one we looked at,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:40 ): ",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:40 ): we put all those log messages. that's, Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:40 ): No, no, This is the API called. It's like all actually. That's",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:40 ): There's a lot going on here. Okay.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:40 ): Beneficial, you.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:40 ): And I will use that functioning. So, On that, I didn't.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:40 ): What is remove this one channel removing this actually? Yeah. because this is also doing the",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:40 ): I don't think this is, what's I? Yeah, I mean I don't know. the trick is You're having to raise condition when you actually do a new chat, I'm not having a problem when I click on an existing chat ID, when you're cooking the new chat button, What I visually see right is that and from the console.log you click the Chat button. It clears out the chat and then half a second later. So probably because the polling the old chat contents show up, Right.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:40 ): So Okay,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:40 ): Yeah. Yeah,\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:40 ): let's just walk through.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:40 ): I got a one.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:40 ): Walk through it. Carefully again like one step at a time.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:40 ): ",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:40 ): So when you start certainly just doing this. Walk me through the message Just a basic idea of the message bowling, So You call update message pulling one, so the very beginning online 26, at the beginning of the loading, right? And the fetching show. Okay. And then you call Update message. Pulling extraction chat, ID from the URL if I refresh the page and go to just the slash chat, right? Then there's no chat ID so it doesn't",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:40 ): Set the interval and at the beginning that none of those are statements, get called, And then if I have a chat ID at the beginning, because it's already in the URL bar, then there's no pulling interval in first, it doesn't happen. The second one happens, it sets the interval to one second that gets assigned to messages whole interval and're All right, we're on that page. I'm gonna go ahead and let's imagine I go and click the New Chat button, right would go to that code.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:40 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:40 ): And start all the way does the event handler for that. So What calls great new chat? Yeah, on that.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:40 ): It's inside you.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:40 ): Okay, yeah, let's see that.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:40 ): Okay, so you just have an ON-CLICK handler, okay? That calls create new chat. There's no arguments, So, it's good. Okay, you go back to create new chat. That's for sure.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:40 ): When it is on the ones. Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:40 ): Yeah. Yeah. Okay and then you say Remove you idea of presentation. Let's just look at that function. was walking is one at a time and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:40 ): In. Thing,\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:40 ): just kind of",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:40 ): where you are.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Okay, remove extract chat ID from URL, You get the charity, that's blocking. Okay, good, if there's a charity. So in this case, there is gonna be a chat ID, right? We already have a chat open so the current URL. Okay, you are all object. It takes the whole thing. You replace the chat ID. You rep place. the slash as Yeah. So, that's slashing the thing and then you grab the Current L that origin plus new path, And then you do history, dot replace state. Okay, rather than push state. Okay.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): So now you've gotten rid of the state. forgetting that I mean I don't know if that's actually correct with the history but it shouldn't cost a problem. We're seeing Okay. And is that the whole",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): yeah, I mean, I said before we go on why replace state instead of push state",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Because who stared, I guess, will they reload? I guess the trainings.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): No, that's Push state and pop state. That's the beauty, they simulate the idea of changing the history right by changing the URL without reloading the page. So generally speaking, the idea when you want to replace it is actually when you want to remove an entry in the history. Right? So that\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): if that makes sense, generally speaking, what you want to do is every time you modify the URL you call push state, And then every and then you just automatically let with the exception of your event hand over for this message polling. When someone it's the back button, it just goes back to the previous one. And then the case where you say, based on information from that URL I should modify the page. Then you have that event handle on pop state. So the idea is, when they hit the forward button, we're sorry, we're the forward button, but when they do a thing that changes the URL, clicking new chat or creating or typing in the first message that names the chat.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): So I thought there maybe was a good reason, which is generally speaking, if I do new chat and then I name that chat I actually do want to replace the state, right? Because that unnamed chat is actually replaced with the name chat and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Right.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): now has a URL. So I actually think you do want to replace state when the first message comes in. But in the case,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): All right.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): where the person does a new chat, Right, you actually want to do a state for a new one.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): But I don't think that's causing our problem, Because the history is not being invoked at all for this race condition. Let's leave it like it is but we can figure that out later if we want to modify the history but the history of music, the least important, what I mean? if it doesn't show the whole history or something. All right. go to the next function, the update message polling, I think there's gonna be the interesting one.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Okay, so you extract the chat, ID from the URL and the idea is now this happens after, right? the URL should be updated\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Out there.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): because The one we just saw actually updated the URL. And then if message pull interval, which there is at this point, you clear, the messages will interval. That's fine. If there's a chat ID which in this case there should not be a chat ID. So you shouldn't actually call that set interval which is correct. I mean we shouldn't have polling going on for the new chat. Let me just see. There's a silly thing but In the case that causes the problem, I just want to see if they're continues to be messages coming in. yeah, so once a second, get all still gets called",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Actually, even in the case where it does delete everything cleanly. And I go to a new chat, the new chat is correctly, not getting any data, so it's not displaying anything, but I see in the network, it's still polling. shoot.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): ",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): No, sorry, never mind. all is for the fetch track.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): the fact that this is another chat already Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Only try again then and Yeah because that's how it went away. it seems like more of a race because a lot of the times when I do it it seems to work correctly, I'll hit new chat and the first time it will.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): I'm not able to reproduce it.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Do it, Fastly.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): There we go. Okay then yeah, I got all the 404s. let's see.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): What's the other one called? Are they both called Just get all chat.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): No know that is the chat slash something like that. It is like, if",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): So this is all just Yeah, and I can kind of tell private edit This will stay gone.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah, and So The polling is getting removed for the messages, And that's not kind of but I am seeing it just like there's a single",
  "01 (2024-09-05 19:45 ): 00:00",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): let's see.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Okay, this might be a race condition. We get with this idea of clear interval.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): because the whole idea with the task is you really can't guarantee much about How the task, you works meaning.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): \u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): a lot of what is them?",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Enter the ideas.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): What? Yeah, this is one of the",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Reasons why sometimes instead of an interval people, do a tail call of set timeout, right? Where it's like this call set timeout. And the last thing that the time out all, or Whatever does is call Set timeout again, Right? Because then essentially, you can kind of guarantee that if you didn't call set timeout, there isn't one more time or event Put in the queue. The problem, I believe how it works is It Set interval. Unlike Request Animation Frame, It doesn't really guarantee any particular timing.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): It just tries to be, the best effort at approximately that timing. So I'm guessing What might be happening Is the actual interval is putting a k scheduling a t in the task, for a short period of time in the future, The browser's doing that automatically, it doesn't wait till the moment. The interval is supposed to Put a task in necessarily, it can do it before we can basically say in 20 Milliseconds. Do this task? And that gets put into the task once, it's in the task,",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Clearing the interval doesn't necessarily remove it Ask you,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Here. Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): There's gonna try I think what's happening is because I notice I probably would check one out of five times before there was the more serious. it seemed worse before you reordered everything. Now, it at least seems like four to five times, it clears the data and then only when the interval lines where it's less than a tenth of a second later, the thing kind of flickers in and out, right? It's never half a second later back with the data.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): What's work under the assumption? That's the problem. And see if we can just figure out an easy fix. In a lot of times it's what if the interval itself meaning the actual thing that gets the polling just double checks, the chat ID in the URL.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): that's Frank, I think no matter what the race condition is, this is kind of the issue with this type of, but we want to make sure that every time the polling happens, That it's safe to do it Meaning okay the polling is kind of like the websockets. This There might be new data. Not so much in the update polling but in actually load chat messages, right? Because that's the thing.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah, even just do this.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah, I've been serve you asked.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Let's just do this right now to make this safer. whether or not this is the problem which is Messages should actually check to see if the chat ID is what's in the URL bar at that point before it calls fetch. And It's the fetch, It should even do it actually Right before display messages in line, 280? After it gets back, the result from the network.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Are you?",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Then it should actually write before displaying be like, Is it still? It's in the URL and we just won't do anything. Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): But more than just, if chat ID equals, what's in the URL bar? right wherever that extract shot ID from Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah, that's pretty safe. Whatever causes the race condition like",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): No, I don't like because I guess, that thing in which it is that time, it is when they find my home.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Because now they see the fetch, it might even just be the fetch which it sends a fetch request Saying go fetch this ID. Then by the time the fetch comes back from the pole, we've switched to a new chat but it just goes ahead and displays it once anyway. I think that's it.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah, guys. That might be a half second time. It's okay. That motivation. That's",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): the mostly I agree.",
  "01 (2024-09-05 19:45 ): 05:00",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Worked once. Or twice.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Three times.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Four times.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah, this Seems to affection. I mean, I just Seven for seven. I didn't get that there the bug reproduce, so,",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah, I get this feel.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Nice.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Better remove.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah, get rid of those log statements. It's a lot in there for it. It's perfect for debugging, get to the bottom of this.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): It's called.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Nice.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): We asked.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Nice I'm satisfied. This is our MVP.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Being.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Great job. this is great. But nice.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): So now, I mean I think it's time to put a live, right? I don't think there's anything else that Me to do.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): They're both for this under the policy. which",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah, let's try to at least add something. so yeah, that we were saying we should have the content security policy before we put it live.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah. Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): That tested out ideas.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah we should always add even\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): even if we have to add a content, security policy and temporarily add some openings, you know what I mean? at least doesn't allow eval or say, we should be able to lock it down. Somewhat, let's start if you go and look at. Again if you just go to Goldsmithai.com and you go to that head, it has the content security policy that I would say is a reasonable starting point. Let's start with that and see what breaks and then just add additional, what I mean? keep expanding those rules because that includes, at least the fonts and then everything else loaded locally. But",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah, the biggest one is even if we have to add script stuff, that's fine. we add style stuff to unlock that, but if we can lock the strip down to just self. That would be quite, yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah, that is a mendota. Anybody else and the extension they always so much change and you should not expect us.",
  "01 (2024-09-05 19:45 ): 10:00",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Something like it. You have any knowledge over that night? They should not",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): What you mean? How there's another rules where you want to set them to none? Right.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): the extent nobody should use any extension to my upgrade, the things.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah, so to be clear, it's not so much extensions. you can signal whatever you want in these content, security policies. The whole idea of an extension is it can be like Sears C+ code you can't stop an extension from doing anything at once,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): ",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): right? most of the content security policy. Otherwise, there's some other rules, like object and bad. a lot of other types that you can put in some sort of blocking for Let's not we can go back and add those but for now, it's more important. I'm more worried about the script, the fact that we're getting Data from the server that's actually script and style tags, right? And particularly the script tags And having those cause problems so be ideal. and if we just had script",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Whatever we call it, script source self, and have that work. Which 200 Default Source Self.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): After that's the reality.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Okay.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah, so I'm noticing two different ones, the style tags. I'm not surprised that you have some inline styles.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): The script. So right, yeah, let's just add to the",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah, so I think we're going to add unsafe dash in line. to this to style because having to edit, I don't know how many places have in line styles,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): .",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): I can do it but I was just a quick search of The.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): We are 10.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): The HTML and just search for the style. Equals.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah, there's not, I guess maybe dynamically in the JavaScript you're adding in the HTML itself. There's only one instance that has an inline style tag.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Right, that okay. I",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Regular first style only. I need to add our system.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): I'm just saying, so here are two strategies are too, options. Are we either say, Wow, our code just has so many in-line things that we just really can't at the moment, fix it which case we can add the unsafe dash in line to the content security policy to kind of allow inline styles. The other one is to kind of say Okay there's only one place where it happens. Let's just fix that and put it in the style. yes, I think for the script definitely we should do that and get rid of that on click because I think that's the only",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): even just",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah. Only about listener.",
  "01 (2024-09-05 19:45 ): 15:00",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): So, if it's a callback, you shouldn't be calling, right? You Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Okay.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): And then the only other one was the logout that's on the air for me to the same idea.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): yeah, once you just did it,",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yes.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Good mornings. any others know and you,",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah, those are the only two. Yeah for the JavaScript.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Don't understand.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): yes or fix and the style. So it's not",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah, for The nut. The nice part is if we were able to fix the style. So there are no inline style tags. We would also prevent the problem of if the AI accidentally returns a style tag, it doesn't run which is really nice, So for example, if you should be able to reload the page and have that old one that you ran, that turns everything green not turn everything green anymore. Is it Just be mechanically blocked by the content security policy. So just walk me through. Yeah. How many places do you actually?",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): I have a good idea this time being month. Yes. They're not touched. 2016.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): So that's why I believe if I understand correctly. But I'm pretty sure applying a style from a script that statically loaded is fine. The problem is when you're generating HTML programmatically and then that's actually including this inline style in the HTML tag, We know the style equals inside the HTML tag or if you're just doing it in static HTML, you can't have a style script or a style attribute. So when I went to the HTML for example, if you go, Index.html there's only one case where you actually have a style tag in HTML.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): I thought I saw one before in the JavaScript, but then, when I did a search, I couldn't find it. usually style equals is a good. Thing to search on but yeah, that's the only one.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): All This planet is your plans. For example, something that is still",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): It's unless you.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Okay. Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Nice. yeah,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): So yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): and then",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): That was the only one that I saw in that page. Yeah, that actually was like and then the only case wouldn't be, I think we do Drop down at style but one in which were you create a new element, right? And then that element actually has a style attribute in the HTML element.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): look at I",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): those are fine. Yeah. if you search for style equals? I think that should find because you think the HTML usually is styles equals quote, right?",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): So I don't see anything. Maybe the one that I saw before was just temporary as what I mean? You're changing stuff and then it didn't end up in there. Thought I was like an AI generated. Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Lost ideas like that,\u2026",
  "01 (2024-09-05 19:45 ): 20:00",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah, maybe it was in login or\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): I guess.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): the other pages but okay good, let's Try to push this. I don't think we should get any As content security policy errors. Now",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): because most of the time you do like ad class or move class and you\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah, because I did there by mistakes.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): For that.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): That I did not got the other style like that. Let's see if",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah, that's",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah, now I'm remembering, I I think was the case. We were working on the login yesterday. We're doing that quickly for the checkbox and some of those things.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): The only reason I remember is I was content security policy. that's it. You think that",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): They're not going to.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Nice So try see if this go to that one chat that you have. That has all that weird coloring right from the and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): let's see if it",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): yeah. Pricing whenever yeah, it is, it has not been",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): And then that block it. Okay, awesome, that's great. Nice.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah, That's the HTML. But that's Fine.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): That's fine.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Actually, I mean it's not security problem.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): alright break the style of the whole page, which looks super like",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): that's huge. Yeah, I thought that was me a lot more. Issues than that. So awesome. Yeah, what's now? We should do the same thing with the login and the index page, but I think it might not even have any problems.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Other than that? Yeah, whatever.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Okay good.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah, And then we'll get index.html that might be.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): but that's right, the login index HTML just at while we're on it, it's kind of curious, Yes,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah, this is not.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): there is no style. I don't know where it's Okay guys.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): All the singing you guys event listener. And I said So probably, yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah. Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Nice.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): The on click is also not there. And style. That's not there. Yeah, it is fine.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): go ahead and just to those two HTML files. Add the head, the meditate. Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): It's like something. And that's just one. Yes.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): The public.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): It's doing three. Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah, I mean maybe I'm looking at Let's add. there's our two more rules. I didn't add but we might as well because I won't break anything.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): And then we'll just do it with all those pages. yeah, I'm just gonna add it to the,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): the one on the Web on the website here, on the goldsmithai.com, I think that's what you're talking about. Okay, so that's on there now. I just refreshed Yeah. So the object stores that prevents flash and not so much extensions but if someone installs our own extension but sort of like third-party plugins, there's really plugins for extensions doesn't really matter anyway objects that the base URI prevents those attacks for people modify the URL so that just it shouldn't break anything and then",

  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah. Yeah.",

  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): It's a funny part of reading. All those stories is it's so easy to be like, I just got how to do that to that and it's selection bias towards and the real and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): the difference between say Is this someone who just kind of got lucky and had something that was good but they got lucky versus is this some really deeply powerful, reproducible strategy and it can be tough when you",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): I had a friend who did a lot of, social media marketing and stuff. and people were always asking, my gosh, I saw that viral campaign, like you got all this, it's and then he told by. And so, he'd used that as leverage by telling people how, you can do this. And he had these almost classes teacher, and they told everybody's that original thing, even though I got a hundred thousand people to sign up for free. Only seven, people actually bought it out of the hundred thousand, I made all my money off of selling people\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): ",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): how to get a hundred thousand people to do something that didn't actually make anybody, my gosh, it's hard to say that and that's why I like, it's funny thing of marketing versus marketing that actually, you watch shark tank and \u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): yeah, it's that",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): I love you. At least the one in the US it's really was like Mark Cuban, Was on the one, the US. A lot of times, you'd ask, you'd be like, I really don't like when marketing",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Some viral social media thing because it's not reproducible. It doesn't really mean you have an engine of growth. That's sustainable. And it's okay now that you had that traffic what's the actual marketing strategy? And how did you actually know what the customer acquisition cost is versus, companies are coming we sell this at trade shows, I know it's a shark tank. if you close sales and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): get purchasers to trade shows, like you're and then especially on church day, they seem to understand.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): they know what they're talking about to a certain extent when it comes to certain things. And so it's like, they know this idea that, for business for back-end stuff. It's like, If you get some purchase order for a hundred thousand units and you don't have enough money to figure out how to fulfill it. That's who we want to invest in, right? It's only just has that. And thing with revenue is at least that's meaningful. it's not like, just eyeballs but even with revenue it could be really tricky nowadays with the high cost of marketing because people are just really hard to market to that. A lot of times, it's like, Okay, how much did you spend on marketing to get that hundred million in revenue? Because if you're",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Spending 80% of revenue on marketing, that's not really ever, how are you gonna turn that into a profitable business? And, \u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): so, Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): it's not bad. If I know we grow to this bag and then we reduce that. I would say, that was the thing was SAS companies. when 10 years ago, it was always like, once you turn that corner, you'll be profitable, and then there's companies 10 years ago that still aren't profitable because they can't stop marketing or they will lose market share. And they never really hit that thing. And so, it's exciting. I will say that ai stuff is crazy because it's just like that on steroids.",
  "01 (2024-09-05 19:45 ): 45:00",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah, you can give you.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): It's so the fad stuff and then you'll see some of these companies that then all the revenue goes away and three or four months and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah, that I went.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): it. Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah. That's not. you need to enter in that particular moment, very quickly. That's the face of getting that big revenue quickly and\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): then jump, then it goes to you, that's not the case, but the technology comes and if you get up at the correct time and take it to the level,\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): that's them like that, He discovered that thing that I actually launched anything",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): What would the other strategy I think? that's the longer term strategy is you use some piece of technology to build relationships with customers. That's ongoing. And that's where the B2B play The thing with the B2C stuff is like even aI.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): No. No.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): It's this weird middle ground, but I noticed that the girls, we got to move it because you did something so easy to use that blows people's minds that they're like, Okay, I went in here in 10 seconds. I understood how amazing this was, because it generated a really cool image and I noticed that that doesn't necessarily make it very usable for businesses, And I think What you're seeing is when you go to businesses, if you're I want to offer consulting. they don't know what they want. And so, then they're still using. And if it's a really powerful tool like open AI, a general foundational, and I platform there's all these use cases, it bridges both. But I do think we're gonna see this shift towards, great. There's gonna be all these things that come out. That's gonna be exciting and we're gonna download them, they're gonna use them. But there's also gonna be companies to just realize that",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Companies are starting to realize, they have to do something with AI. They don't want to spend a lot of money and take risks. So, saying again, We're gonna pay 20 or 100 dollars a month for anything that our employees actually say, saves them time and is actually integrated. And so, you see something copilot or something, like Gemini actually being the things that companies are spending a lot of money on right now.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah, actually the co-pilot thing, actually.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): We'll do it sustainably.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah but I think you'll see domain specific ones you'll see legal medical real estate like coding. I think and then as we build this always got to figure out Okay what is it that we actually have that's specialized and I think the trick is you don't want to support everything equally because then you're spread too thin but I do like that we start with this chat tool that's general purpose enough, That anybody can kind of just use it for whatever use case they want. But then I think the trick is not just having one thing either because that's risky that it could be wrong.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah. Yeah. That thing. Mmm.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Having something like three to five. Domains are kind of interrelated that we already have expertise in our specialized then and so that'll be great. Yeah. why is this thing? The snapchat forever.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): All right, there we go. Okay, cool. Sorry.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Drop what?",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Three. And I separated out now that we have yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): The crowd on. Yeah, that's",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): All right.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah, and then I think I'm still gonna go with",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): the one that has the intel but the smallest one, I don't really think we're gonna run into resource problems and better to see as we do early and then",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Rather than spending extra money, And then Yeah, I think for the production one. Doing daily backups. Is a good call. The nice.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Part is by having On the thing. It all back up the database as well. And then We might not need all these, but I'm gonna do.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): those four so that I can ssh in if we do need to do, if later we add some sort of Get lab something, we'll figure that out.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Monitoring.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): He media got one weekend. But Alia area,\u2026",

  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah, let me just concentrate on this. All right. Okay, New York, three production. That image eight dollar one. Daily. That issue that's metrics. Good hostname. Production. Okay.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): What did I call this live? How I eventually chat That's fine..",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Make these more consistent later.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Okay, and then I do want to",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): power these back on so that we do use these for develop even though I was kind of developing on the live one because I want needed to integrate with yours, you know what I mean? Now that we're pushing to production, I'm gonna stop doing that. I'm gonna go back to doing development on so kind of until Monday after this We'll just kind of not do any development that way. We're not screwing stuff up, you know what I mean? Because we don't really have",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): this really set up.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): The biggest one is we need to make sure maintaining separate development and deployment databases, which kind of takes care of itself. Because right, we're just having them on the instances and then we have two instances.",

  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): If it downloads intense.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah, that's the database and then it'll ask you for the password afterwards. So I think that actually just postgres again. And then it'll ask you.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): You must.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Because the psql command. Isn't a TCP connection, It allows you to disconnect without the password, if you're the user. Okay, so that then I'll give you forget the password to go in there and change that other example they had that's connect over a port\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Focus on.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): where you actually put in the port option. I think forces it over the now.",

  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): There was another option too, but you have to put it localhost and the port and then that'll",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Force it to do it as if it were.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah, instead of do it as the root use around the postgres user. Because the only way you can connect is if you do it using what I mean? Yeah, the TCP connection. if you do the dash, you postgrass, like you'll be able to connect without the password because you'll be that user. If that.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): so remote",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah. Yeah. That makes sense the postgres user on Linux can always access the postgres database no matter what the root user will have to go through. The. So then it's just pseudo psql. And then you have to put in Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): And So then you have to actually add host name as localhost port, and you have to put in the port number and then the pat and then all the other arguments because it's visit connecting over the network, right? It's simulating as if you're another process in this case our server or something so yeah. Dash H local host - d gold proposal - p and then you need the",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): I think, in this case, It's the post, So do netstat net stat or something it's the actual postgres port.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Or tool Or whatever. Are you into use?",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): ",

Let's see if we can get it working again and that'll kind of like what I mean? Tell us narrowing on where that problem is that we can get it working again by changing the password back. Then, there's something it's definitely related to the if we change the password back, and then in the environment, variable and restart and suddenly it's still installs. It worked then. We got some other. What else?",

It's like, just filter those out with code and have something that works. It's just includes it. Always, what I mean? Have the alarms, I always include this tag and then have a code that's like if it opens and closes with a stag, Remove that.

And it very quick, it's escaped it to be safe but don't double escape it. That wasn't sure that's and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Hold also In the court.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): less than,\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): that's what happens when you double escape it, So that's what it should be, if it weren't also so when you do it in a code tag, it doesn't. Yeah I mean it's just weird thing though where it's like you need to escape it so you don't have script tags loading and you don't have the problem. Someone could inject the closing code tag so it's not really very safe to use the code tag. For that purpose, right? So generally,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): .",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): you want to have generate the pre-tag, and then have everything be escaped. Exactly. Once. And then it will show up correctly.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): But There's a good part two. Now that we have this thing where we're saving all the chat, we have all the chats in the database. We can go back and use these to create an eval pretty easily because there's kind of go back through the history. Find the ones that cause problems and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Okay.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): then just manually copy those into a test folder to run an automated test.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Level are. Yeah. Play with audio. So give this round to them as well, see how they give them respond. Because they also have something like the formatting thing particularly",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): I find it works pretty well though, I mean, I think there's been a lot of effort to make it so because that is meaning they have this feature preview and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): it's very evident.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): they have the code features engine speaking. I think they do a very aggressive job identifying when the output is code and then saying, we're gonna format that correctly using whatever system. My guess is certain parts of it are quite static, you know what I mean? We're trying to kind of use LMS for everything because it's really convenient.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Really. Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): I mean it's really easy whole prompt. I wrote using this life, it took me, three or four days to make this program language but then to build this first set of problems,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): only took 20 minutes. I mean we should be able to rate on the AIS and the cool part was because this programming language is so straightforward. I didn't have a single actual error in the first run of the program the prompts were perfect but there was no problem with the stack or anything because here's the problem. Template prom.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Template prompt as they all right? Yep. I could have a syntax error and so it should be easy to have the AI generate code in that language and then we just gotta building out. Evals is actually going to be the biggest thing, Because if we have really good test cases, then we can actually use synthetic data and actually ask quan open AI right or GPT I generate. things and test them.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): But I'm still not getting.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah. That's yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): okay. I mean I know they had to be something stupid and it's the wrong email address. Why am I I looked at postmarks delivered and all right this is",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Without what's wrong with Fastmail? that's not our problem.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yes, there are many magazines.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): just,",
  "03 (2024-09-05 19:45 ): 00:00",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): So, this time, I got one that did show the HTML without those less than signs. I just asked for pricing page, but it still has the chat message and",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): And it's not like converting. The markdown that's in the narrative very well.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah, let me try. Let's go one more.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): I was like, one idea.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): This.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah here try rerunning that same prompt the Facebook one. Again like a separate new chat. I'm curious. I just",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): In.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah, just added a couple lines to the prompt see if I could get it.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): which, The job, just",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Hiatus.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah, that one worked pretty well Didn't.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah, I thought this world channel. This is also separate on the five sexy, how we got. And that's",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Thanks. Yeah, go take that very first problem. We'll just test that one again. I didn't copy it from the first one we put in or palace area. Tournament your copy So it's exactly the same that way. We're actually testing, \u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Don't worry.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): I mean,",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Our three of them.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Okay, just it for a test. It would be nice to make it exactly.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Where that open a new tab, a new track copy that, exact or\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Okay.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): email it to me, I just want because I've changed it. So I want to see if that actually by itself.",
  "03 (2024-09-05 19:45 ): 05:00",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah, right.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah, Dopa 2017.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah, that's great. Yeah, it's a good test.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah, I'm actually curious running top, just curious to see how much like CPU,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): I think,\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): they actually use",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): I think.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Is it already got up for delivery on?",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): yeah, built a whole HTML page but then it didn't",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Didn't make it pretty formatted.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Okay.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): that's,",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): That's just,",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): yeah, we wanted",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Okay, so that one did a better job? Yeah. but this is the problem overfitting with it, broke that other",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): It still didn't do all my markdown instructions.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): For when yeah,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): the formatting.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah, I bet that explicit.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): I was like, even if you have to escape don't, convert other mark down to HTML.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah, this is good that we definitely need to build that evals and yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Almost right. I30.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Nice. Okay.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah, started. Which translates.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): In the one that I've formatted bad what HTML tag did it actually? Generate. Yeah,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): ",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): for that one. Yeah. which was per year? Was it code that it actually tried to put that in or was it neither did try to put a P tag. Me if you like F12 and he actually inspect like that giant block of code.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): So, It just plain tax,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Messages.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): okay, it didn't even put any age. Okay.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): I wonder if that's because if the full response was a standalone HTML document So then it didn't add any wrapping or do anything.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Make some people already, just think about different.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): That will see.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Because the way that I'm doing the prompting is I apply the formatting instructions from the user as the fifth step, but then there's a sixth step. I have all these custom instructions, be still generate HTML, That actually seemed to work better. I just added it to actually just have a one line that's like\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): On.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): if the only input you're getting is just an HTML document, still put it in a pre-tag and wrap it and so that",
  "03 (2024-09-05 19:45 ): 10:00",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah, I'll show you real quick. That soon to work pretty well For this example, I was Create a blower Plate HTML page? So realize it's gonna generate this pure HTML and then that the wire just given before is gonna be this needs to just be like nothing and this. Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): So yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Mmm.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): yeah, interesting to see the use case is",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): so the thinking, okay.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah, I mean that's pretty good actually.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah, much better.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): And I mean I'm very explicitly. Told it nothing outside the tag so I kind of see why it didn't add, you know what I mean but even though, yeah, they're separate pre-tags",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): And yeah, they turned the markdown into HTML correctly this time.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): That I already responded to give perfectly",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): This is the test case that because it's semiconductor stuff. Even when I went to the supercomputing conference last year and they're all these AI companies like what we try this and it didn't work on any of them. And I was like, All right, this is the knowledge. The problem is there's a Wikipedia article that's wrong about it and there's just no other information on the Internet about the semiconductor. Thanks so it's in the textbooks and everything but Everything is clearly getting the same explanation. We're gonna have the same problem unless it's more like it just as added some semiconductor knowledge.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): the multi-stage, prompting probably Won't help.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Okay.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): But I was really just more testing. would it put the code in? It looks pretty good. I mean,",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): you are privacy, our collects So long essay and",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): All things.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): this one's bad.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Right. Not actually.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Why that?",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): One thing I saw,",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): In the new chart. I guess it is showing the goldsmith that I think continuously.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): I noticed that. Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): I think something it's sort of. What's the price?",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): But science the study. That's See the max problem.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): As. Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): so that \u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah, looks good. And it's not just yeah,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Be better Polished everyone.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): we can improve the displays. Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah, the paragraph thing. Got tested properly, I guess. These are created,\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): I should schools evolution work. And this was a song, one.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Nice.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): That's always good. But right, there's one just lines. Or whatever.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah.",
  "03 (2024-09-05 19:45 ): 15:00",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Actually, I mean, now I'm just thinking out loud, as we go forward, since it takes so long to do each thing, it's actually pretty likely. This is how people are gonna do it which is keep adding more chest. So actually having in the chat button, I mean on the sidebar the progress have a spinner built into the ones that are still loading. Once we had web sockets, that'll actually be pretty straightforward to be like this one's done, this one's done, and then it's like, alright, the spinners just kind of go away and Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): because this is only with six stages of prompting and no search, and no code running I think we might end up with something where it's design me a page and here's a markdown document that I did as a spec and that's like, five minutes it'll take me five minutes to do that and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): it down, once we have evals, We might even have time estimates to help people, to be like, all right, check back in a couple minutes in the meantime,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): ",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Why don't you just Start another channel work on the marketing copy, New York, suggest other chats to start to Help the project or something.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Interesting.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): It's definitely gonna have a different flow though,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Not for",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): than chat GPT or quad because of the latency nice. That's really good though. That response. before email is",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah, this one got a little bad I guess or\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): We're going to create a poster.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): don't know what.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): but the only place it",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah, the fact that the markdown is in converting to HTML. And\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): why did it add tags? I assume it's because those the angle. Brackets are actually causing it to be like, I'm not gonna like but I don't know why those guys in the first place.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): understanding Obviously, when I'm next something not regular area itself,\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah, that's actually the best we can do\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): but in the yard, Mmm,",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): because that is designed to then be shown using these math libraries that display. So at some point just like image generation or syntax highlighting the ability to show a nice fraction, right? And",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): But we can just look into whatever. I'm sure the fact that it's coming out that way is because that's the raw output from Chat GPT API that can't add all that weird stuff. And then that's the standard feedback like thing. You put into the standard display library.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah, and that's another really cool one that I think we can do because we have this code interpreter and it can take a while is something that's like hey come up with an example physics problem of an incline plane and actually generate an animation that we can preview or something and really have whoa, that's a crazy. Also display",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah, that's another good circuits is a good? Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Here.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): There. Yeah yeah, that's a good one. Funny question.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Here That should be a pretty straightforward question. Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Able to solve it.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): I like Having an ee, eval actually because that's something we both. Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Was that from the car that was from your class.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): \u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): I'm assuming I just",

  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): It's not this example in India are awesome when you pass in the third standard. So, I never think I was already there or\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): ",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): not question as we are.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): That's so.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): What's the low except Presentation.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): As you turn from the hardest problem. I get",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): 75 Loans.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Thank you.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Did that one? You have the answers. So a practice,",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah, that answer the word just with Maryland, charity.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): We've learned fortify.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): But does that using the same values? Are you sure that's actually with the same?",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): That I spent.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): yeah, power and instruct any of these that would change the value just,",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah, 300 times. It is three hundred and other explorer.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): The adoption is, how much amongst you?",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah, it's like this if I",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Still, I'm impressed with the amount of intermediate scratch pad stuff that it's doing. So I have to imagine this is, yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): They did perfect.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): At least that,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah. And\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): as you can see, Nice.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): then service, They just 24 pi into 10 list of minus 3. So it gave approximately, then there's 75.4.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Guys, awesome. Yeah, yeah. That's great. Yeah. So we should definitely.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): This.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah, build out an important thing to do, relatively soon as build out our own eval that will And it'll be great.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): We have you. Work on that.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah, your sons are tested.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah. Yeah. man, great job. this is awesome.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): We got a live, congratulations. This is Accomplishment.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah. Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): And it looks great. I mean it's really good and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah. that response is nice.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): it's gonna be exciting.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah, one or two times it breaks what might already time it is or the property. but,",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): And there's just a starting point just the fact that this is all didn't really put too much into the AI and it's already something that's decent. It's gonna be exciting. And I'll be trying to have people Try it out And see\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): what they think. Was good.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Still notation.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): All right, I'm gonna get going here. This is And great job. I'm sure you're tired too. This has been,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Thank you.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): a lot of work or the last couple weeks. So we'll take a break for the next three days. we won't touch anything and all. Yeah, I'll be demoing it to, \u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): at least JD tomorrow. So that'll be cool. And then yeah, no. And hopefully, it seems like it should be pretty reliable. I mean we have all the stuff set up with the restarting everything so it'll be great just feel like set it there for three days and let it run and then we'll figure out on Monday What was your workout, but I'm excited. This is awesome.",
  "03 (2024-09-05 19:45 ): 25:00",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): yeah, I said",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): ",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): okay, then",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): All right. yeah. I'll see you then.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): We have got done with the \u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Yeah. Have a good weekend. Enjoy yourself and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): here. Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): relax. Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Session. Okay.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-05 19:45 ): All right, awesome. See you, right?",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-05 19:45 ): Then see you on Monday.",
  "Meeting ended after 03 (2024-09-05 19:45 ): 25:46 \ud83d\udc4b This editable transcript was computer generated and might contain errors. People can also change the text after it was created.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 18:48 ): Yeah. I actually push that for and\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 18:48 ): Hey, John.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 18:48 ): I got some errors, I think there's thing and God finish with that thing. Today. So, I was thinking now the main part is of the socket\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 18:48 ): Thanks.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 18:48 ): because I guess majority of the issues which we added lab I have a big majority of them. Only one major issue is the drop down. the feature is the major and What we say mini database kind of thing. For us internally getting the news the stats and all portal stats are required. I've added one comment in the gate, lab. You can see that.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 18:48 ): Just one.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 18:48 ): So, the result stats I'm thinking to for us should be true visible to us only total number of user\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 18:48 ): ",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 18:48 ): who act interact with a child, user retention rate, terms and condition accepted. and for the chance, total chats for you, the chat duration that title link",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 18:53 ): And then the also message types like the response time between the user and the chat won't reply and the total number of conversations in that awkward. But usually you can say on conversation per chat also like average. How many conversation takes place between the chat and what is the ratio of the HTML versus the normal text reply, which we get from our response and what's the disk Error Rate. I don't know how we'll add but we can add if there is no reply to any certain message, then we can say that Are something like that, and Cautionated I'm thinking that cost.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 18:53 ): Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 18:53 ): Should we not be that? We should go further to convince for cost because GPT and cloudy and all the lens have the pricing as for the token.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 18:53 ): So we should power towards that thing, not think on the town. So the cost basis thinking down to the open basis. are get that opens how much the user is using and then you added our pricing or\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 18:53 ): I mean,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 18:53 ): something like",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 18:53 ): that's how we would do cost with the tokens, I mean, that's the same thing whether or not we restore tokens and then they change the price surprise ocean. Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 18:53 ): Yeah, I like store that opens. Yeah, and then that thing like how much is the prompt reply in HTML replied?",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 18:53 ): Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 18:53 ): Open distribution that thing and the time is energy. This is hot. What can the user uses the highest and What's who are the user, who is using Something like that pattern and magic link usage rate like the magic language was generated and who has used that we have that thing for the usage rate and conversation depth. That is the maximum number of conversation. Took this in one chat. You can see, I guess I added that in the message also. I would say that.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 18:53 ): and conversation, abandoned trade, meaning the percentage of chat with only one conversation And presentation rate also with good who are stopping aging with the chatbot over time. So these are the metrics and stats, you can say which we can add in any database in the JSON.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 18:53 ): So I mean yeah the trick is really thinking through I mean this comes out of the flexibility when we're talking about visibility into what's happening, our pretty broad spectrum all the way from stuff,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 18:53 ): ",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 18:53 ): like churn, usually, keep performance indicator and is actually Sort of subjective, right? Because you have to make some arbitrary choices of What do we define insurance, And when does a user turn out,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 18:53 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 18:53 ): there's other stuff that's really straightforward, number of messages. So like that.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 18:53 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 18:53 ): And then we want to think through what kind of flexibility you want? Because ideally, you want to be able to say, Okay, we have some question about our application and we get easy for us to kind of say, We need to answer that question. Go ahead and crash it. The trick is some of those things, right? we talk about a database or dumping this to JSON. The question is, how many of those are simple? these are just queries of the database that were day every day kind of making report, right? And then how much of this is actually things where we're collecting",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 18:53 ): Work where it's trickier to do that, right to figure out where we actually make changes to, kind of upstream where we have to do something significant to kind of collect that data, so the one hand we have some stuff that I have to make some changes to the AI collecting the day, for example, right now, I'm not sending how many tokens it is. But that's a pretty,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 18:53 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 18:53 ): obviously planned. I'm doing and pretty trivial. And when we talked about, the cost, right? It was always going to be based on collecting how many tokens for particular model and then just figure out How are we gonna present that? And as the pricing changes, we collecting tokens. we are returning the report the price, or we also collecting the price as we go.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 18:53 ): Because price is something If we include the price earlier, this may tokens is this price, and then we put that hard limit the second, okay. We stop generating or, something like that based on the current pricing of those tokens. so that sort of like it would make some beyond that information and bubble that The other idea with this is sort of this is a lot of metrics practically, I mean it's good second, all this data. So of them seem like more actionable than other ones,",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 18:58 ): And so there are good so that they just think its This is a good set of things but it's a mix of all these different. things we just gotta figure out kind of what the prioritize and sort of what we want to actually do.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 18:58 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 18:58 ): Yeah, as good like brains, okay here all the idea here, all the things you want to record. So things like the Magic Wing, Open rate.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 18:58 ): ",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 18:58 ): That's good to check for the case. Where something really breaks when the open,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 18:58 ): This.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 18:58 ): Goes down in Year Zero, then it's like, Okay, that's not good. Other than that, it's probably not that usable. Because you know what I mean? it's just like yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 18:58 ): You better get the sign up convert and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 18:58 ): sign up converting actually happening. that thing",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 18:58 ): Yeah. so this,\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 18:58 ): I mean so I mean I think the biggest thing for us is to also think of it okay,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 18:58 ): ",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 18:58 ): so we have all these metrics but it still doesn't really give us much visibility into What people are actually doing, I mean these are all numbers\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 18:58 ): Yeah, the child.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 18:58 ): which is good. Yeah I think it's more important. That we just pulled the data out, \u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 18:58 ): ",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 18:58 ): if that makes sense at this stage, this is a good in the future thing to say, with this dashboard, we can, if we had the ability to sort of monitor the dashboard and say, we see, there's some problem, or we see we've marginally improved. if we really had gone, if we go through and say, from marketing and sales perspective, what are our key performance indicators probably starting with this idea of",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 18:58 ): Hey.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 18:58 ): What's the North Star metric, right? that's kind of the most, like, the current,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 18:58 ): Hey.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 18:58 ): what kind of doing with some single metric. And our goal is to make that always go up and then understand okay, What it would feed into that northstar, what? KPIs me that or\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 18:58 ): .",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 18:58 ): some magic collect those and then actually put the good. All right, every week.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 18:58 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 18:58 ): What are we doing to improve that? The challenge of this is trying to figure out like what?",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 18:58 ): Yeah, for each one of these what is gonna be actual because okay, let's say we categorize these, I'm gonna give three or four categories, So one is from a marketing perspective, recognizing our users. using words like a bandit, right or turn, right? Is this something showing that users are happy with the product because they're using the product, a lot type of thing, right? The other one Do we have technical problems? are we detecting something like real increase in some metric that \u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 18:58 ): Mmm.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 18:58 ): My gosh, things not working fundamentally correctly, where it's almost acting as a test. So for example, that could even deeper of something, Are we getting a lot of 400 or 500 errors versus 200 success. suddenly that's a very coarse metric, but often that's used because it's so simple pick. my gosh, we're seeing some spike in 500 errors, what's look into it, what's going on? So there's those types of errors and then I'm gonna call this third category, That's where you actually get really granular of saying, Are we actually sort of not in a statistical way but with visibility able to sort of anecdotally look in and see, okay, what are people?",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 18:58 ): what are people kind of doing with the application and that's just for this in a traditional web application. It might be actually pretty straightforward with analytics to kind of like they're using this part of the application using this. Yeah, you have a to-do list app or a scheduling app and you say Okay, are people actually scheduling meetings for later people using",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 18:58 ): Sort of this feature level analytics for us. I mean, because that's the challenge of the simple Application is, at the end of the day users chat with it and then all the sudden that doesn't really tell you much about What are the use cases. And so with, one way we could go is to kind of say, Okay, let's categorize some of these use cases just is doing Generation is somebody doing right email is just Of course general knowledge worker like business stuff is just like technical is this question and answer right? You're doing a knowledge type of question and sort of classify prompts and that would be you but that's a whole other can of work kind of go into.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 18:58 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 18:58 ): I mean I think is a good list because number of these are really important, I'll say that. So that's good that you put that together and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 18:58 ): Yeah that's right in the comment and\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 18:58 ): think about",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 18:58 ): care it will always useful for sure.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 18:58 ): But yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 18:58 ): We look back in the future what does things we have planned? Like we thought about and we can implement Are they think that's",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 18:58 ): Yeah, I think for now starting with the simplest idea which is Take.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 18:58 ): Getting all the Data. Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:03 ): Yeah, just getting all that data and dumping it and then it turns out it's relatively easy to just say, my gosh, we need to write a script. just like a Python or JavaScript sandal and script is We have all the data JSON file shoot. This is the question we need to be asking of the data. and to be able to poke around and kind of respect. let me write this five, wine thing, that answer some of those questions potentially, And then kind of okay as we build the thing out, It makes it. So we don't have to answer all those questions actually writing, like a postgres query, At some point of future. We might say, we actually need to",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:03 ): To write some query against that for the scale we're at the beauty is like we should be able to write those postgres queries. They should perform five right?",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 19:03 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:03 ): A lot of these questions too often. This is where you start adding these column date of it. It's shoot, to answer that question and you end up scanning the database, you kind of have to aggregate all those things. This is where you can easily have aggregation pipelines or who do personally back. we're actually organize this by those metrics, right? We're not gonna need, which is good, but the trick is. It's small enough that we don't even need to write postgres queries to answer these. I think what we need. we really need to see is",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:03 ): I mean it's okay that's why I divide this into these categories. I think if I'm just sitting here back my gosh, what's going on on our website and I can't figure it out right there.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 19:03 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:03 ): Yeah, there's two things. One is the website, just working correctly, which to some degree measuring number of magic,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 19:03 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:03 ): links being open, is kind of good, but the problem is",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:03 ): That doesn't really tell us much when we only have a few people clicking on them, Because we get three users and they don't open the magic link Why didn't they do that? We don't really know the reasons. They didn't really want to use their application. They didn't have their access to their email when they did it. They realized. I need to use that other email you kind of don't know\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 19:03 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:03 ): what the reason is and they don't know its technical I think for those technical ideas it should be more about us. Just adding monitoring and testing manually and being there's a thing work correctly and then for the visibility into who are How many users do we have? Yeah, that's I think even the idea of did they abandon the chat? We don't really know. Maybe they were doing good enough job that they're getting the Correct on the first question. Right? Because we're doing this long form answer and suddenly the idea of what does it mean to have an abandoned chat right to be. Doesn't mean asking one question or maybe that's actually the goal versus simply saying Yeah, our people are people, you won't, everybody using it every day and the more importantly, my gosh, we got some user.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:03 ): And what do they actually put in? So we can start classifying down the roadside. We mainly looked at some chats and then said Okay they did some email I know we kind of add that as a category later. so I think frankly just doing we got assistance was really just busy dumping the database to a JSON file. and then maybe thinking through what do we actually need to store in the first place to answer some of these questions and usually the answer is just, store timestamp for everything. I mean, that's usually not a bad idea because then you have the data. So for example, a good one, you had is What's the average response? Stop, right.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 19:03 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:03 ): That's gonna be a really important one. Which generally then the question isn't so much, are we saving that it's own database, but simply are we recording the timestamp in the database when both those events happen? So for your new schema? Probably that makes sense for the time stamp. When a person created the prompt and then a timestamp. When the AI responded and then it's easy for us in the future to mention going to, shoot, we need to worry about response time. Let's add that query and then dump that, to some five because the other part is with This is business intelligence or usually what happens is, you can't",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:03 ): There's some questions that, you're gonna need to know the answer to and so it's relatively easy back. Okay, we have visibility in the back question but a lot of times the problem becomes some problem comes up or something or some realization, my here's the question we need to ask, and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 19:03 ): Hey.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:03 ): then it needs to be as easy as possible to ask that question. When the time comes, which usually means really did. We collect the data in the first place? And that's the whole premise behind the sort of Big data movement, Is always save everything. And later some business person will go ahead and ask that question.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:03 ): I mean, you'd be amazed, especially here in the DC area. There's more people do it that do business intelligence than there are software developers. It's insane.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 19:08 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:08 ): If you go to these meet, coding coffees pick me up, people who use tools like power bi, which is the Microsoft like that,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 19:08 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:08 ): like visitor, and the reality is, they're not writing any code, right? Because that's kind of the beauty of it. The data, all the day is just being collected, it's being dumped into some Database, that's maybe not normalized like Mongo or something like that. And then those people are using a gooey to create almost you do a library type of, query and just pick up. I need to know the type of questions came up with and that's typically, not uneven developer. And some after the fact business analog, I don't know. that's a good question. As I talked with our customer, I talked with, the client and the answer this question, then they just go and ask that question of the data, and so a lot of the data science stuff, that's not like language models and machine vision or that some of these model oriented things are really just put that query into the",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:08 ): You ask this of the user and some of it's a really large scale, Where you're the government hire some consulting company to ask some big question of its data to put some report together,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 19:08 ): Mmm.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:08 ): FBI report on violent crime in the United States, it's not so tricky, it's not so simple because you have a lot of disparate data you have data and bad formats, data qa and so I don't want to trivialize it in our case. It just comes out of that simpler. Question of Okay we're not safe we have to kind of decide what information we're storing as we go and we want flexibility, and that's tricky because flexibility comes at a cost, With software. If you create all these abstract things that seem really flexible. You have it Done the real thing. and so this is good. So if you look to that list you made, probably the best question to ask isn't so much at this point, What are we gonna make a UI to show those answers?",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:08 ): Calculate those answers. But simply what do we need to add to the database? Get what more information. We need to store now. So if we needed to ask that question three weeks month from now we'd just be able.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 19:08 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:08 ): You just be able to write a postgres query and it would work and if it scans the database That's fine. We don't have that much data. So I think that's part of it. And then the other part is to say, okay, and then in the very short term, What information could you just sort of dump to JSON that? and I even think the idea like Here's what I would because I mean, frankly, it's sort of more like, I want to be able to Look at something every day. Here's actually what I would think would be perfect. Would take all the changes that happen in the last day, dump those to JSON.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 19:08 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:08 ): So use those time scampers doing a simple, scan use a timestamp,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 19:08 ): ",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:08 ): select everything where you\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 19:08 ): Background. Drones that thing.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:08 ): the time says and then",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:08 ): Yeah you doing a crime job like nightly and then grab any new user that signed up that day, any new messages they added including the actual content, then in the cron,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 19:08 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:08 ): tab job, send that as an email to my email address,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 19:08 ): Mmm.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:08 ): frankly with crossroad. That's how I was doing the new account. That's how I was getting all the visibility. I mean, I was just using Postsmart and basically doing a nightly Quran job it would just read through even dump the engine. Next logs, and then node logs into that email with a graphic expression, So that way if there's something like how many people access this endpoint? just grab the engine next logs or something and then just copy that into a field and chase off and then just put that in an email and then the trick is it's really silly but for example",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:08 ): When there was this denial of service attack against the website, like Prospero, the reason I knew about it is I got this email that was 15 megabytes long and I was like, what? And I was like a 15 megabyte engine X log and I went to the timestamp, it was only in five minutes. I got a, tens of millions of requests and I was like that. I don't know that much traffic, but no, you users really signed up. this is definitely a denial of service attack. Because I mean that you get exactly five minutes of,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 19:08 ): Yeah, that's why. Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:13 ): that type of traffic. And so I Think about what, for a daily update I think. Yeah, that's the biggest thing is. And then if you just did one, where you said, okay, Do that without the timestamp So that we have everything that's happened in the past. Sent us an email, And then put in the cron job with the daily timestamp. And basically that way I want to see five people signed up yesterday. I get that in an email and I'm like Wow five people signed up and then we got total of 20 prompts and if we get to some point where",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:13 ): It's like this is just too much. Then all we do is just change out that script. So instead of it being in an email it's being saved to a file, right? And then we can actually write a script that's Though that's weeks worth or something and actually put that into chrome into rag or something and then do some LM, quit being like Hey categorize these prompts into these categories. We're a couple of the list of categories of these fall into, we can't really do it manually anymore. We'll use Llms to kind of work on already talking, that data into what happened in the last day. And the idea is this is then sort of independent of the actual database. So we don't have to worry about I'm doing some sort of database query to back. we get that information. We're just saying we're taking every day's change and just",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:13 ): Dumping into a JSON file. So it's human readable because for now that's gonna provide that visibility we need to just be Okay, Are we getting people signed up? Are we? And that way You don't have to build a website, To actually just be like a dashboard, but at the end of the day, an email with JSON is readable, right? It's like Yeah. Okay, you just read it.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 19:13 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:13 ): It doesn't have to be fancy or anything and just already recording those time of stamps and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 19:13 ): and by the,",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:13 ): then the beauty of the beginning, email and JSON is. If I do want to ask some questions like, what's the average latency? I can actually copy and paste the JSON file on the mind machine, and five line, script just being take these fields and subtract those two times stamps, and kind of ask, whatever questions I need of the data. If I happen to accomplish some or you happen to come with some new question and then it becomes easy to kind of say Okay you can't answer that question. That means we don't have the data in the database, the first place and we know we need to add, Time stamps or cost or do I really think it comes into this? there's really yet three things. We do need to add, which is timestamps for every every time, there's a database query,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 19:13 ): Yeah. Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:13 ): that's a timestamp. Then we're gonna have the cost of the AI. So I'll do that at some point and that'll be easy, that you already had those fields so that you kind of take care of it. And then,",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:13 ): The other one is that error idea. I mean I really do like this idea of when we have an identifying that I think what we actually maybe should do is add an error field to the schema actually for the conversation because there's some errors that might be like,",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:13 ): Silently. But if you don't really know what went wrong and we don't actually have an error message, the server was down. So the server didn't return error message or something or the end point was wrong. But there's other errors, where, We might actually be able to have the language. We don't quite have this at this point, but we might add another check to the language model. Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 19:13 ): David Sunday. this thing you're going on.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:13 ): so there's something like that we're thinking someone asked for so. Safety is even another one where a person's they ask something that we should flag is other trying to poke around and jailbreak the thing",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 19:13 ): Yeah, because they already gave me. There are straight away. Don't know\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:13 ): Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 19:13 ): why that thing you avoided inside, what happens with API or\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:13 ): Yeah. Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 19:13 ): does it give",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:13 ): Isn't reusing chat, It's like whatever DVD 40 does. ours is kind of gonna do whatever the underlying model is, we'll do it. But then there's another type of air though where it's, the LM can check at the end and kind of say I know there's some We didn't follow the instructions, but we weren't able to, And not because it said it was dangerous but simply it did not fall the instructions correctly but it was like we fixed it and suddenly it followed the instructions correctly, I had that problem. I was using it today to try do that chrome on something else and",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:13 ): I mean maybe it was just like okay it was someone ambiguous in the prompt but it still was like I disregarded that thing about chroma but it was like, Wait, If I ask for it, why didn't you know, it kind of made an assumption and was like,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 19:13 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:18 ): Okay, what you asked for, didn't make sense, so something where it's more like contextual or if it's like, Hey, we weren't able to convert the markdown, or it said There was python code, but there's no python code and then have another pass the very end check Are there any mistakes here? Finally and then dump that into some error message or where the OM actually doesn't.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:18 ): For some reason, we have the rate limiting. That's the other thing I did ran into when I was going to Evals where I did the parallel, and I was saying the rate limiting the problem right now is at the end of the day, the scripture running still returns a string, so it's not like a 500 error. If you hit the rate limiting, you'll just get back some sort of probably XML or JSON that actually, then shows up in the final response I've ever read into that, with the actual chat tool because it's very hard to hit the rate limiting",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 19:18 ): one.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:18 ): I mean, as a human you can't run hundreds per second. you can with a script but cases like that. Where we've got it. But the trick is, we've got to actually have an LLM read the output and the thing about rate limiting is with it's the same API key then it's not good. I mean it won't work that I don't think won't work anyway.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 19:18 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:18 ): And so what to think about that but that's something I think more important than that, though. Yeah as if Even the time sounds like we can add the time whenever that makes sense, that we can add that the cost we can add, that'll be good. That more important. I think rent a moment is simply getting an idea is is anybody signing up for it? And are they doing chats?",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 19:18 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:18 ): And what's the actual content of the chat? Because that allows in the short term to kind of focus on",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 19:18 ): I got that one.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:18 ): Because, I mean, even under these evals, the evals are good, if our goal is to, do well on the evals from the scoring perspective. So that kind of have that in the back of my mind. But the more I look to the questions, the more I was like, this is okay, but I'm really trying to think of how do we want to sell this application as What is it in terms of and you show me, it's really clear. It's like this is about search or perplexity. This is about search. If you're not using surge, use something else and then it fits into that mix of tools where maybe you're like, Hey, I want knowledge built in the AI, I'll use quad, I'll use it. I want to do Internet search. I'll use Reflexity, I'll use Andy, something like that until Co-pilot and Gemini clearly fit into I already have, all my Google docs in Ask Gemini about them or something with copilot. And really trying to figure out",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:18 ): If our audience is technical, if our audience is web developers that we've got to add more features that are actually close the loop on web development or audience is more technical than that, that we've got to close the loop on those other things. and realizing all this stuff like rag and when I was doing more about that guy that went Sunday, the end of the day",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:18 ): Rag works for a lot of these people, it's just kind of this crazy thing. That all the people that I talked to months ago, who are doing this for the companies, right for enterprise or government. Rag is very difficult to get to work, Because they have terabytes of data or petabytes of data and they're even internal, wikis that have thousands of documents, right or tens of thousands of documents and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 19:18 ): ",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:18 ): figure out exactly or I was trying to do with the United States code, it's 200 million tokens, a couple of million works. that's so much that even an expert lawyer doesn't actually know what all the code sections say, they generally know, it's organizer finding them and on the other hand, when a user is I want to upload 10 pdfs and What's in this video? Yes. Do answer our question, that and then they like, anyone. Ask the next question. Keep using those PDFs, and then maybe Upload another two or three PDF, even someone who's like an academic who's like, my gosh, I got all these research papers open the reality is they're probably have 10 or 20 or maybe a hundred papers. They actually care about that are related to the topic that they're doing. and at the end of the day, even if that is a hundred or two hundred megabytes,",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:18 ): It turns out that when they're there was that paper that talked about graph search. I'm gonna know,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 19:18 ): but,",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:18 ): whatever it's like, I have the word graph search. And now this narrows it down a lot. and the ability to basically saying, Okay, we allow people to upload those PDF files you out, a lot of these features, the challenge becomes you add a bunch of features and that doesn't really answer the question of, what it's useful for, or what it's differentiated on, right?",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 19:23 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:23 ): and so, I mean, at some point the trick is we just gotta figure out what that is. I mean I think that's such that the beauty of China that's open. I know we can get people hopefully to be like, you better try, use shotgbt and then they'll use it. But I think we're gonna find is the use cases that we get are all over the place. It becomes hard to kind of use that to really narrow in on a particular use case. and I think,",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:23 ): Figuring out, either just deciding okay, what are the use cases we're focused on or and then making evals that are specific to those? I don't know. So, I'm looking at rat. so I'm gonna call it in about half an hour with a guy from the National Press Club, to talk about the talk that I'm gonna give in a couple weeks, which I thought that would be a good opportunity to promote the tool, Because there'll be, a few people though and who's works are private equity firm. We'll probably just focus on AI funding, she'll probably be there and ben this other guy who does Enterprise ai stuff and then, a bunch of other people. So be good, maybe by then to kind of have some like, yeah, this is sort of the thing. I think for the talk, I want to give it on rag, which I'll have to then go force me to get that working, at least a standalone thing.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:23 ): But I think that sort of figuring out What are these specific? use cases or what are these things? So I mean Yeah, I generally, the application as an application, they're just the better, right? Because at the end of the day, we have a solid application and then it can just, build on that. And so some of the stuff like, error rate, that's all good. so the other thing that I'd answer this last time but it's really switching Forum Mini because then You leveraging for a mini more than the bigger models,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 19:23 ): What?",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 19:23 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:23 ): because that'll keep cost down. And then we'll really be able to put what can we get down with for a mini and then use more search and rad with for a mini rather than a lot of the built-in.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:23 ): Reasoning and that way we can really kind of, maybe have some lower price because what really Yeah, I mean, this is the trick, the idea of paying more money for something that's better is simple, The challenges we then have to be better and it's very hard to be better if we don't actually have data from real use cases from real people, In the same way that open company that already has a bunch of users is Yeah it's not just as abstract thing or\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 19:23 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:23 ): these public data sets. It's like our users did this thing and the beauty with four Mini is We can really then extend the free version. I was doing the math on that some more that I mean I think if we set a reasonable choking limit and then say this is no longer a trial, we really Have a free plan that you can kind of use forever. You only get so many tokens per month and then if you pay a reasonable amount of money",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:23 ): Hours a month, you get more tokens still using only mini. But I think the beauty of Mini it's cheap enough to hundredth the cost of, one. So it's just like you really can. and the trick though is with the rag, This is where I've got to dive deeper into rag to see one thing I realized is the only way to get the eval scores higher and do an eval. Just doesn't matter because it's not very difficulty. The gradual level knowledge is the one that is the challenge. The only really challenging one at this point. And the only way to get a higher score is to really,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 19:23 ): Know.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:23 ): leverage rag on documents that are within that domain, Otherwise you get the same thing. There's no way to do better prompt engineering if one doesn't have the answer in it which it doesn't for certain percentage of the questions. There's no amount of problems Engine gets the answer out of that and the whole point of those is they're not.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 19:23 ): One.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:23 ): Directly Google searchable. So, if you do use search, as a way to get the information, it becomes really cost prohibitive. Unless you do an efficiently, because you can't just grab one answer in search.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 19:23 ): Running.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:23 ): You need to do iterative, you\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 19:23 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:28 ): iterative search. We're actually getting out I like first principle approaches and then doing it calculation later, and doing proper research, like an academically do. And if you running the models on all those responses, it gets customer in a very quickly. So the trick is I've been reading rag papers today. Basically because there's hundreds of papers about dragons, I went over the survey paper and kind of went from there. But the trick is If you just do naive rag we just generating The good part is the pricing for the embeddings themselves is even cheaper than 01 Mini. So text embedding three small with opening Two cents per million tokens is one cent per million tokens with the batch.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:28 ): API And so suddenly you really can Take a lot of search results generally embeddings for those and then search those embedding is just like is this even a chunk that we should include in another stage of prompting to get at that? And that's I think the only way to",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:28 ): Tax should be able to say yeah we got a hundred percent on these evals by researching that idea and then research in the next idea and going down sort of like the Wikipedia rabbit hole and then going on Springer and searching some of those ideas in real academic journals. Taking those pdfs and converted us to embeddings and then alright, is there anything in this article that, Actually it tells you how are you supposed to solve this problem? If you're a graduate student, in biology or in chemistry or something and then using those techniques and going back into either for many or it sounds like, I don't know. If you saw it, we just got access to the '01 preview and 01 Mini in the team.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 19:28 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:28 ): Yeah, I thought we already had access to it but I got the email today for opening eyes.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 19:28 ): Yeah.",

  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:28 ): Does that help on those evals to\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 19:28 ): Now.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:28 ): then kind of use that as that selling point of being? but here's my feeling, it's like, okay if we do well in the evals that is good from marketing perspective, That's the go to market strategy,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 19:28 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:28 ): but it's gonna result in really high turn. If that's the only thing we have, Because people are gonna use it, they're gonna go, this is better than they use it. And if it basically works the same, we can't charge more money. And frankly even if it basically works the same but it's the same price. So even if we're using for many right and charging twenty dollars a month, we still have this problem that it's very hard to have as polished a product that's as integrated as, GP to your Claude or Gemini, or co-pilot in particular, where people are already having their doctor, know what I mean? I already have at work documents and so, page, 20 bucks a month because it sounds pretty interesting. I'm busy getting the same",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:28 ): Audio results from my use cases. And then suddenly, it's like, Okay why am I doing? Let's see what the new of catchy PT is, Let's see what the new model of plot is doing. I think we need something that actually is more qualitatively differentiating, which could be the previous more I was from a security standpoint. This is what I still don't have a good answer. From a really strong security standpoint of being like what if we really want to run people's code and we're not giving them. The dedicated instance at the very expensive price point, we're saying, I don't know, it's shared, we run but now all of a sudden you can actually do backend development or you can do Brian development, We actually run JavaScript and not just HTML and CSS. But the problem becomes it's just really like",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:28 ): From a security standpoint or something like, gosh, we're letting our whole content security policy works. Because we're basically saying all the code is statically written by us and we loaded in If you have the content security policy. What if you notice when you read those a while OS, Top 10, A big problem is you have the content security policy and then Use your generated scripts to be loaded off of your domain, You've undermined the entire security.

And even using secure cookies, the other person's client that they shared that with suddenly just fetches, their credential or doesn't even fetch your credential. Just that is their other, prompts or delete their account or, just allows the person Of your credential forgery and using Joe Subdote other subdomains other stuff is one way to address it. Then I'm all setting up like an internal DNS server typically, because the problem is if you",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:33 ): If you use just a big public if you basically we just use the digital Ocean API to Set the DNS records. You don't have a good way to invalidate them or set the. so I think more about that would be nice feel to run to actually take no our secret sauce here is web development I mean this is great for Web development\u2026",

  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:33 ): Yeah, or even just running scripts like we you do some sort of like so a data science was the other one that I kind of realized that it's not exactly as much in our wheelhouse. It's kind of the trade-off but would be a lot more straightforward just like you upload a CSV file that has your data. We do a bunch of llm stuff to clean it. Then we just generate an extra boost model for you and then that runs in some cloud GPU and there's really not that type of security risk that you have one development really back end of. I mean I say the front end part is the problem but that's actually a lot more reasonable. we could just do the sub domain thing that wouldn't be the problem. The problem is really, when you start saying, we're gonna have back in development, we're gonna let you use any technology you want between. Now, be installing stuff on the back and cousin, there's a whole point of doing the diamond thing was like, Okay if you have some use case for you really want",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:33 ): Us to install custom software, Just pay us a lot of money and we will have a person managing your software. You'll have your dedicated instance you want embed system software. You got hardware in the loop we'll set up a proxy that connects to your actual location. We'll do it on whatever you want for twelve hundred dollars a month. And so somebody like doing embedded system, or if you're we do fluid mechanics simulations for the plastics. Industries fine, for you. We'll do whatever crazy thing you want, because I realize, that's mostly What's lacking with a lot of these solutions, Is that they don't connect to that ground. Truth, you can't run the thing constantly to just, get data out of whatever thing people already running, and, doing it all that other stuff is this security time, especially when it's like",

It's like videos aren't and they're from videos something that we don't do well enough and obviously there's demand for video, But I think that misses the power of AI in the long term in a more broad sense. I think that's the other thing is we've been doing a good job of putting our heads down, particularly you, And just in getting stuff done. So we actually have something right rather than sitting and talking about ai. But that's for the problem is we haven't really been spending much time in the last few months, taking a step back and saying, Okay what do we think AI is gonna look like in true years in five years in 10 years, right? Because that's gonna have to be as we move into the next phase, What determines what we build, what we focus on, right? I don't think we have to do that right now though. Because the reality is we're in this chat thing if we can do. yeah. I like keeping the eye on the prize of kind of saying okay the goal is to do all these emails because the way I see it is\u2026",

  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:33 ): if we can do really Easy valves will get it. Now I'm more convinced we need to have a free plan because we do all these emails.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 19:33 ): ",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:38 ): We get a thousand people using it. Even if those people aren't paying and then maybe we can get some of those people paying twenty dollars a month or even like $10 a month. I was thinking more about it. That frankly,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 19:38 ): Right. I'm thinking like this thing.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:38 ): if you're using for a mini, it's so cheap and we can refine the front. Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 19:38 ): Keep the use for Roman in the background. Give the pricing as for the one, when we are one big, whatever you find suitable, because they have the higher pricing. And there was used in the same logic we have behind us in China part, so why not really keep that way Use forum in the background. I have the prizing as for one minute so that way you will sustain the competition and people are not think it's much why it's kept higher, because we have also written that thing I guess we have it on over, we are doing behind this in multi-shot, from doing something like that thing.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:38 ): But it's not exactly the same chain of thought and we want to make it better as we go. The other problem is, at the end of the day. one preview. If you take their API pricing and then you said,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 19:38 ): ",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:38 ): If you press the product, you've been losing a ton of money on those $20 plants, right? maybe I want is the thing with it being not, there's no transparency, Maybe. one preview actually, isn't that big of a model and their API. They have 80% gross margins on in which case, they can afford to do it. But the reality is, I don't think that's the case. I it's been, I think, one mini and no one pre-owned preview in particular, is mentioned directly compete with Call on 3.5 Sonic. It's exactly the same price. Right? I mean that's that giveaway and it's, slightly better on all these emails. But if you take it as being similar to the previous ones where there,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 19:38 ): Thanks.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:38 ): maybe you would break even on it sixty dollars for a million put When we did our one day of testing, we just the two of us during 40,000 output tokens.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:38 ): Right, which means if we sat there for 25 days, right? we would have spent $75 worth of API time that month and if we're being charging $20 a month that's a 300% loss,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 19:38 ): Good.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:38 ): it's not even, just like, we charge 25 dollars. It's no, which are twenty dollars and the worst case. s and we didn't do that much testing. the guy that I've been on Sunday who's just obsessively, Does the wizard beat,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 19:38 ): Yeah. Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:38 ): the warriors are using two hundred dollars of the resources.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 19:38 ): That big",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:38 ): I just like, Yeah, but okay, I agree with your idea which is we use one mini. that's what I kind of mean that They're only charging $20 a month to use 01 preview, right? I think the trick is saying, Okay, I do like having a higher price point for us like a hundred dollars.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 19:38 ): Nah, I was feeling like this thing that use for all many four.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:38 ): But Per user. Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 19:38 ): Many and\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:38 ): Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 19:38 ): have pricing as Over one mini whatever. Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:38 ): when you say and have pricing for and who's pricing, what do you",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 19:38 ): No, no. I am saying, this thing. We will use the model called as 40. Omini Four. OH, Mini? And keep prizing as oven preview or\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:38 ): Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 19:38 ): over meaning keep rising. I'm doing not use though when we are one preview.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:38 ): There. I know you said, but Use the numbers. what pricing are you talking about?",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 19:38 ): yeah, yeah, but I think that thing you can say that's just like,\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:38 ): I saw.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 19:38 ): it's like you got the more point actually",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:38 ): Yeah, I'm not. if are you talking about the API pricing? Are you talking about?",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 19:38 ): Yeah. If you're presentation, yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:38 ): Okay, I mean that's such a big, I think other show what you're saying, which is we charge 15 dollars per million input tokens which is the one pricing.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 19:38 ): Yeah. Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:38 ): We use the Mini behind the scenes, a lot is on your side. the challenge with that is so one that the question is, do we really want to charge per million? Do we want API pricing like that really say per million tokens or simply monthly pricing that has a token limit. For the people, I talk to, it seems like most people, they don't like the API pricing because they don't know how much they're gonna use. So it's unbounded. So they're worried. They're gonna spend a ton of money, but the idea of saying, if the price is low, then they know,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 19:38 ): ",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:43 ): they can try it out at that price and see what they end up the other way to view it is I don't think people are I'm gonna use a million tokens. They view it. I have no idea what that means but I know what twenty dollars a month is. So let me try $20 a month, and I know what a hundred dollars a month is and I'm not gonna try a hundred dollars a month, unless I have some good reason to kind of prove that I've already tried it. And now I think a hundred dollars a month is a price point that can be sold to people that know that",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 19:43 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:43 ): so for example if you said we have a certain token limit for 20 dollars a month,",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 19:43 ): The guy like that can explore that.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:43 ): Yeah, they hit that and they're like, I'm actually using this. I use it for four or five days. It's incredible and it's helping me. Now, I'm going to pound your dollars month because I understand this concept of just I'm paying five times as much. It took me a fifth of a month to run out of the tokens. That's great. I'll spend a hundred dollars a month and that'll be great, or something where it's like, and this is trickier. This is what I kind of had in mind, but it's strictly where it's like. Okay, you use for a mini at this lower price point, right? And then suddenly realize that, there are some cases where it doesn't work as well. And now, let me try the hundred dollars a month to see if this more expensive thing does work or more qualitatively different things. let's say at the hundred dollars about when you actually can host your own API right then you're like I tried the 20 dollars nothing. It actually generate these API endpoints but I couldn't share it with anybody else. Let's say for a security standpoint. That's a lot easier, right? Yeah. You actually can use node or do something like that in some sandbox, but",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:43 ): You as the Creator, can Internet use the application and then in the $100 a month, plan, your other people on your team. other users can test it or something like that. There's really pretty clear cut upgrade type of thing or even just storage for embeddings that's another one having chrome that's like you get a hundred megabytes of storage for the $20 month plan and then you get gigabytes of storage with pretty simple. You upload your PDFs at the hundred megabyte limit and you've been using your happy with. I found but to pay a hundred dollars a month.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:43 ): It has to really be superior for some use case,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 19:43 ): I'm good.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:43 ): doesn't mean for every use case, because always really care about being some particular use case.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 19:43 ): Okay. Yeah,\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:43 ): If you're like, this is the best in class and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 19:43 ): I got that.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:43 ): I use it. It's just difficult for us to do that immediately and I think three reality is for twenty dollars a month, or again, this won't even think actually charging less to make it Don't even try to have this idea that we're the same as a plan. Make it ten dollars a month and basically it's like Yeah we do do the the thing is the gap between",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:43 ): Borrow money is a hundred, the cost of Owen preview so we can afford to only charge $10 a month and have people use it not unlimited but quite a bit of usage with Forum Mini even with our Multi-prompting. so the math kind of works out in our day where we tested, we each did about 20,000 tokens of input and twenty thousand tokens of output. That's only point three cents with four with the outbreak about one cent total which means that over 30 days that only is 30 cents, plus whatever the embedding costume and search for being another 10 or 20 cents then it's actually If we church $10 a month and they're only using 50 cents per day, that's what we have really really high margins. The irony is jumping up to even for a regular but then definitely Owen Preview.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:43 ): It's like that's a hundred twenty times as much for a hundred times as much for Oh one.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 19:43 ): I don't know.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:43 ): And so suddenly it becomes Alright where do we want to use those prompt? So, what I'm thinking is, even in the expensive versions, we want to mostly use for a mini for formatting for HTML generation and then only have one prompt in every response that uses.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 19:43 ): Better than majority. And",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:43 ): One or four.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 19:43 ): I use while the first date that I saw that thing,\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:43 ): Yeah, and then I don't know, you can't even with yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 19:43 ): it is to consume a whole large amount of glass team that is output and all it's very long, very descriptive enough,\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:43 ): Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 19:43 ): I've seen that thing and yeah, within one shot you can get",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:43 ): And so at this point, a lot of it has to be flexible based on what we actually get working. on the AI side, I think rag is gonna be the key because I know that a few things one, we really can't rely on fine tuning\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 19:43 ): Yeah, I read that. I",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:43 ): because that's a big up front expense. I just can't afford, So the reality is and on the other hand, So a lot of things you'll see this chart where it's rag, fine, ning combining, those approaches. The idea is because we really need to find tune this or for a little bit of an efficiency loss? Can we actually just go ahead and do a few more prompts without fine? Tune I think the answer usually is generally speaking.",
  "01 (2024-09-24 19:43 ): 00:00",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:43 ): Then on the rag side, I think is where we have to be with the BTE evals by basically saying, We do rag and we do search better not so much in the way that Andy does better one off search where it doesn't understand the context, but much more like research, like a graduate student would do of saying We have a problem that we're given to solve, that's pretty big and we can go ahead and solve that because we're pulling in these documents and then really efficiently. So with route, I was reading these papers. I mean, at some point we have to actually do something innovative. This is the hard reality of the thing.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 19:43 ): Yeah, and",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:43 ): That's really innovative in the AI space to actually be competitive in this winter. Take all thing. And without any budget, going ahead and actually being innovative is the toughest part. Everything else is just like,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 19:43 ): Yeah. Yeah, I think this way.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:43 ): sure, we need the application to work.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 19:43 ): Yeah, I was reading last Sunday.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:43 ): but",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 19:43 ): Yes. In this. There are any prefer rag over,\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:43 ): yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 19:43 ): find winning for the new knowledge. That thing. But guys finding it is like, thank you for creating your own data set,\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:43 ): Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 19:43 ): and all doing that stuff. and in the back, that thing is not that",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:43 ): Yeah.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 19:43 ): ",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:43 ): It doesn't into We're fine-tuning, can be helpful in that mix where you do both is a lot of times to improve the efficiency of certain steps.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 19:43 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:43 ): So for us, we're doing this multi-stage problem.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 19:43 ): That thing I was thinking,\u2026",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:43 ): A good example of fine-tune would be\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 19:43 ): yeah, that was a gift. Mmm.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:43 ): fine-tune the HTML generator, so that something like that, but a lot of that actually just becomes a versus variable cost straight up. And we want to air on, We have to basically not have these fixed costs, Because we haven't raised money so we can't afford to say here's a case we're fine tuning. If we did a million problems would save this percentage. We want to say fine. We know that this isn't the most efficient way to do it, but it works and it's a little bit more expensive.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:43 ): And so yeah. Where's rag the trick? So after I've been reading newspapers my gut feeling is that Okay, so here's what I think we can innovate on rag with rag, right? you're basically feed in data and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 19:43 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:43 ): chunk it and then generate embedding for those chunks put that in chroma database. And then when you have a new query, you basically like hey have that ry. Go ahead and retrieve, whatever chunks match that embedding of that query, put them together.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:43 ): The here, I'll Sherman ice cream. First, I ain't going in a couple minutes, but this will be good. This is what I'm gonna talk about, who the other guy anyway. But yeah, this survey paper. It came out about six months ago. Is pretty good at summarizing all the various techniques. Forget that. But yeah, first of all, if you look at these are all the papers that they included in the survey, I mean it's just so many different. techniques and here's that idea you got fine tuning and this idea of you take your prompt, you do a few shot, you do chain of thought, this is kind of where we've been living and then you do naive rag and then there's advanced rag mod drag. And then you kind of say, Not fine-tuning by itself.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 19:43 ): The.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:43 ): But fine-tuning, the rag steps because some of these are different. I don't think that's the right way to do it, though.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:43 ): But okay, so here's this idea of the traditional rag. you provide your query, you've already indexed the documents and then you do retrieval, right? And then whatever gets retrieved gets included in the prompt.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 19:43 ): The.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:43 ): Then the idea is these advanced techniques often have this idea that before you actually retrieve you use some prompting to generate. What this query for retrieval should be they got a queer queer,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 19:43 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:43 ): routing query expansion that all day and then after you retrieve the day, you don't just dump it in naively, go through and say, now we actually read through the documents and see if some are more important summarize. Some of the documents fusion actually merge concepts from different sources like a final thing, that's pretty sure for what it's missing here. Is if you notice and then modular space is take some of those techniques, And kind of subdivide them into reusable modules so that you can do a better job of iteration and then you get to these techniques.",
  "01 (2024-09-24 19:43 ): 05:00",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:43 ): Here we're basically the idea is you do an iterative approach to refine that or you actually modify the queries based on the results like you would do in a normal research, which is almost like What does adaptive kind of ideas like, if you get the answer right away, that's great. If you do some research and you find that you get more information, that requires you to do more research, will you do that until you're happy with some sort of answer. but all that still revolves around this idea that when you do the indexing,",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:43 ): Right here. It's all independent of the use case, And so what you generally are doing, you're getting an embedding just based on this raw information which is not very useful. But I think the real trick is to say before and there's a cost right here. But before we actually, put this in chroma and do the embedding for certain cases, you're running a prompt against the raw data before you index it to generate additional information from that and\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 19:43 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:43 ): then that's what you're actually putting the embedding.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 19:43 ): Okay.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:43 ): So take an example we have a JavaScript Style Guide or something that's 100 pages long is they're just the style guide in.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 19:43 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:43 ): You might actually start with some questions being which one, does this have to do with naming conventions, just have to do this topic or if basically take the actual use cases. Question is this appropriate for this use case? And that way the embedding actually reflects use cases because then we do the retrieval. You're not just retrieving Hey, does this have to do with this topic? But I have this particular use case. go ahead and retrieve information, based on that, and that's already included in the embedding because you don't necessarily need some different embedding, you can use the big thing, betting, you do generate texts though that top speaks to those attributes that you actually want to retrieve on.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:43 ): And a lot of this comes down to almost the way database is going to be back normalize or denormalize. this question of if you want to make reading really efficient you need to know when you do the rights, what your goals are, So this gets we're talking about today with this business intelligence. It's nice to be able to say, I can ask any question in the future. That's the most flexible thing. But the cost very high\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 19:43 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:43 ): because you have to store everything and then have a way to query everything. And with this rag would like, our date in Postgres? That will be fine as well. Do that right? Because, It's in a database. But with the rag where it's like, I'm gonna do a bunch of searches. Should I cast these results? What should I include? You kind of know when you're searching for something. You have a purpose or not? Right.",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 19:43 ): Yeah.",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:43 ): And so not just searching to collect a database of search results that are like, what's the topic here? And so, I think that's the trick of",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:43 ): Knowing and that's tricky because it's no longer agnostic to the retrieval problem. The beauty is a current ways are pretty simple. It's Have a thing where you dump PDFs and then, It's in your chroma database and then that retrievals were all the work is and you're good. I got to make this better, but none of it really allows you to met. For example, the chunking needs to be context sensitive. and more importantly, this fusion should probably be happening to a certain extent on the input side, you fuse, you create a document, then you put that with an embedding rather than just the tricky trade off, though. Is it can be cause forever because of the reason you're using rag in the first place is just cause prohibitive to run a language model on the data at all. Then you can't run it on the data during the input phase, right? So I kind of came up with this approach which is a three step",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:43 ): New generate a raw embedding to understand the topics then you do a single pass with for many over chunks. That might be a good fit to and do fusion It doesn't require a lot of reasoning but really asking the question using an LM like is this?",
  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:43 ): Related to the question you were asking or is it just seem like it on the topic and then that's running on a subset? you're good at Google Search eventually, that seems like That's the right page. And you actually go to the page and that's not what I'm here. That's a different idea and then use that with a single passive for a minute. So, it's Chief and then, finally, you've aggregated those results and those into the rag thing that's getting old by the final actually doing the reasoning and answering whatever the problem,\u2026",

And I think for us for use cases Web development like searching documentation online as a good example of that where it's like, Hey I want to search the Web and I want to search MD and search the Web, We ten different queries, Find the official dogs, Find a bunches back, Overflow response, I just doing things to have any of them have the right topic and then synthesize that all into And then kind of store all those intermediate results in rag. And it will,\u2026",
  "Murali Singh (2024-09-24 19:43 ): Yeah.",

  "Steve Goldsmith (2024-09-24 19:43 ): a couple minutes. Yeah, we'll pick up. I don't even think we talked about the Web socket thing really, but That's more morning. That's good. All right. Student.",
